1,"Let's bring in Phil Mackie who is uh there at the palace. We're looking at Theresa and Philip-May. Uh philip and I can you see, can you see how he's being transferred from the helicopters? It looks like as you said, the beast, it's uh it's got its headlights on because the sun is beginning to set now. Uh certainly sinking behind some clouds. It's about a quarter of a mile away down the grand drive, uh leading up into the courtyard. So uh you've seen the pictures there of the Prime Minister and her husband Philip-May. Uh They are now awaiting the arrival. I can see that the limousine itself is still parked. I can see any movement in the distance there to see whether or not the president is on his way. This is running a little bit late. I think you probably notice Cathy and Christian. We were expecting this to have happened a good 15 minutes or so ago, which means that all the vis members of the cabinet, the business leaders have had to stand there for about 20 minutes. It's not a cold evening by any means, but nonetheless, they'll probably be getting a little bit fed up of waiting for the president. Uh But we have also seen uh the American press Corps arrive in, in mini buses short time ago, uh just in time to witness this scene, which will look rather spectacular, I think because it does look absolutely stunning. Uh looking down that long drive towards um where the president's limousine is currently still parked. I'm afraid to say uh and beyond that, the statue of the Duke of Marlborough who built uh or had Burnham Palace built for him. Uh Thanks to a gift from the nation after his success in the wars of the Spanish-Succession. Uh just over 300 years ago. Uh lots of lenses, long lenses pointed in that direction, but still no sign, I'm afraid uh of any movement from the limousine. It looks like the Prime Minister and Philip-May are gonna have to wait a little bit longer. Um Yeah, I am the, if I'm the number ten's communications shop or the White House's communication shop, I'm giving myself a pat on the back this evening with these images because they are spectacular. Uh The lighting. Look, there you go. The Prime Minister and her husband Philip-May also color coordinate with the guardsmen, the guardsmen all standing there. It couldn't look more perfect for them. Could it Phil? Uh it's absolutely stunning. And if you think about it, this, this isn't an official state visit. So what, what better place to come than the only non royal palace and the only palace not either owned by uh the monarchy or or by the church. So this is the only other palace that could come. But you still get this magnificent uh baroque palace, beautiful landmark well-known throughout this country. Absolutely there with the massed bands of the household division standing to attention ready for the arrival of the president. It looks, it's just exactly what Donald Trump wanted and it's probably as close to a state visit as you could have. In fact, the four trumpeters, the state trumpeters of household cavalry are only ever deployed for Royal when the royal family is present or when there is a head of state. So again, you know, it's just about state visit except it's not happening at Windsor Castle and there is an even more pomp and circumstance. But I suspect that the American audience is, this is plenty enough as we just wait for the car, we should just spell out what's going to happen tomorrow because the meat of the visit of course is tomorrow. So in the morning, they're going to go to a military base to see a joint exercise between us and UK special forces who have worked together before tackling Islamic terrorism. And they're going to be given a show tomorrow when they go to that. And then in the afternoon, they're going to for lunch at Chequers, the country of the Prime Minister, of course, and while they're there. Uh there's going to be substantial talks, not only about trade, but also about security as well and presumably that is where they're going to be talking a lot about the trade deal. And I would suspect that there will be senior members of the cabinet there. Maybe even Dominic Raab, who is, of course the new Brexit secretary new to the job but very important in not only what is going on with Europe but also with the United States. And there you go, you can see the palace, you're seeing it. Yeah, the pictures of the beast coming up the hill. I was just starting to think that they were making the Prime Minister. Uh wait a little uncomfortably long before they actually turned up. But here, look at that, the beast roaring over the horizon into the courtyard at Blenheim Palace with the British and the American flags flying. Uh the president inside. If you want a projection of power around the world, there are a few better ways to do it than to turn up in this particular car and James, while we're watching this, he's going to see the queen tomorrow. How many of the presidents has she met? Do you know? I mean, I think there's only one Ami right LBJ that she, she certainly didn't meet uh Lyndon johnson. Uh but she has, I think a, a Morocco track record."
10,"Do you think Mr LeBron James will be patient enough to wait? Yeah, he'll be patient for a year. Not for two years, two years next year, you'll see him get another big time free agent in there. And I say this will, I'm sure you got a lot of opinions. I'm telling you when I, from what I say is from, I know because I've talked to lebron's camp and LeBron is one of the smartest players that we've ever seen play the game. So when he looked at that Lakers roster, the appeal to him wasn't another star wasn't a big name as in when he went to Miami, the pill was cap space. Something I can grow with something we could make some trades, make some movement myth, but there are a lot of options there that he did not have in Cleveland. So LeBron, you're gonna look at year one and be patient now, year two, you gotta roll, you gotta take the first year to just kinda get the lay of the land. What does patience mean? How are you defining patience? What do you, what do you mean? He's gonna be patient? Year one? He's gonna go out, he's gonna get it what he has. He's gonna fill it out. If they don't win a championship, you won't see LeBron James pulling out his hair. You won't see him waving the towel. You won't see him yelling and screaming at teammates. He's gonna be patient. He's gonna ride this out and he's gonna assess the roster. Well, maybe not. He assessed the Rockets roster, but they'll assess the roster at the end of the day and you won't come back and hear LeBron James saying this is a failure. We messed up. We had mistakes. I got you. Now, I'm so happy I made you define patience. I see the fear in your eyes. I wish the camera would take it right now because you're faking a smile to cover up. You're in trouble. You got, got, that's it. Will LeBron James be patient for a year. First of all, let me just lay down a little runway. I like this move. I like that. He went to LA. I like the biggest star on the biggest stage. I also like that. He went to a young team that's about building that he can, he can revitalize a cornerstone franchise of the NBA. I like that. He didn't just go find the best basketball roster out there and join it to, to win the quickest championship. I like everything about it but don't sell me be. Yes. Okay. That's my one line in the sand that I always draw. Don't sell me BS and tell me it's something that it's gold. Here. Here's this, it's nice. It's gold. No, it's not. It's BS. He's not gonna be patient and I don't care who you talk to, to be quite honest. One of the problems. What are your expectations that you keep throwing it out? What are your expectations? I'm gonna tell you my expectations. It's gonna require patience on your behalf. I fear that lebron's patience will be like yours. Momentary. Here's the deal. Give me one piece of evidence beyond you talking to LeBron because there's a curious thing about people that talk to LeBron. They say things that LeBron agrees with, they say things that LeBron wants to be said. So I don't disrupt or I don't, I don't take away from you that you might have talked to Rich Paul or LeBron James and I'm sure they're telling you the way they feel today. But give me one time, Ryan just one. You can have the entire arc of his career. You can go back year by year and you can show me where this patience has been illustrated in the past. Just give me the year, the team when he said, you know what, I'm cool sitting back this year and everything that goes on around me. I'll be cool with it. I won't pull my hair out. I won't have a February melodrama. I won't fire off a tweet mid February talking about, you know, I don't know, maybe some kind of, uh, Aesop's-Fables of how teams should, should, uh, compete. He'll, he'll give us some cryptic tweets. Something will go down in February, he'll be unhappy. He will lose his patience. Does that mean he's gonna say, spend all your cap money right now before the season starts? No. Does that mean he's gonna say for? So, how is that? How is that If you, if he's, that's why I asked you to, if he's sitting here saying we don't need to start now, we gotta have Kawhi, we gotta have these guys, you gotta make moves, we gotta, we gotta blow this thing up. Everybody who signed is committed on a one year deal, you just said he understands this is a rebuilding process. These are young players, you can't throw out the word young player will and say he's not gonna be patient in the very next breath. And yes. No, he's not looking at a championship this year. LeBron James obviously knows that's not realistic. So for you to say that he's not gonna be patient. This is a lie. He would have went to Philadelphia, he would have forced his way out of Boston. Have you said he wasn't gonna be patient? He went to L A for a year of patience. Clearly, I like the idea in theory. No, you don't. I like the long term build. I believe that things rich Paul LeBron James are telling you, I believe that, believe it today, but that doesn't mean I'm going to buy the idea that come February, January and March, he's going to be patient. And I have asked you a question which you have not answered. What's your show me the point in history? You can have all the years of his career where he's been patient with a team that is not winning up to his expectations. Give me the time and I will listen and you will win the debate. But show me in the past where he's been NBA finals. He literally played in a year of chaos amongst chaos. We saw the blunder from Jr Smith and obviously there was frustration, there was frustration in the locker, we saw frustration on the floor. But if you watch LeBron in the press conferences, he was cool, calm collective."
11,"Where does James Harden rank as a player? Not in the top five. I got him six great player, top six in the NBA at any point. Look at any point in NBA history. That's a great player, but I'll give you five names. Now I take before James Harden, LeBron James who by the way, just played 82 games. So if everyone agrees he's the best player played. Do we need, do we need, do we need to break the news? Do we need to break a news alert? That's what we need. Are you sure he's gonna do I need, do I need that two when healthy Kawhi Leonard who by the way has been a finals MVP and a great two way player. My choice for second best overall player in the game when healthy three take your pick ad or KD. Which one do you want? Cause it's one of those two and the other guy is four, practically 7 ft great two way players, both with all world offenses and great defenders, especially ad there's four guys I just named and five. Look when push comes to shove you taking steph or you taking Harden, Steph-Curry, whatever credit you want to give James Harden for creating the right culture in Houston. And he has good for him. Unbelievable job he has. That's a winning personality he has, oh and by personality, I just don't mean that he's a nice guy, which he is, he obviously has a charming personality, but that he's a leader in the right way. Even if Chris Paul is the emotional leader of that team, Harden created a culture that a guy like Chris Paul could fold right into. So, so he, but who has a better culture than the warriors, Steph-Curry, the unselfish superstar, the off ball screens, the welcoming in of KD, the whole thing created a situation where KD even wanted to play there. The ball doesn't stick with Steph-Curry, right? What superstar in basketball does the ball stick with? At least actually Steph-Curry and ultimately Harden hits a lot of shots and he's a good shooter, but he's a volume shooter who's a good shooter. Steph-Curry is maybe the greatest shooter ever. He's just a better shooter and shooting is actually both like the where a lot of both these guys values wrapped up. I'm taking Steph over Harden. I got Harden right after Steph. That's amazing. Sixth best in basketball. Here's my thing. I'm not gonna sit up there and tell you that you're off your rocker because I can understand why you made all those selections. I can understand why anybody make all those selections. I'm gonna take two of those names out of there. That'll put James Harden in the top five for the purposes of this discussion at this particular moment in time. I'm gonna take Kawhi Leonard out of there and I'm gonna take Steph-Curry out of there. Now, I know that sounds sacrilegious coming from a basketball such as myself, they don't call me Stephen Naismith for nothing. But let me break down what I'm trying to get at you. I'm only talking about for the season in the moment at this particular moment in time. Obviously, I look at steph, I consider him the greatest shooter we have ever seen. I will never deviate from that. I know how formidable Kawhi Leonard was not this past season because he only played last nine games, but the year before. Ok, I get all of that. Do you know that Kawhi Leonard never averaged 20 points game until two seasons ago? I mean, this is what we're talking about here. So we know what a stout defender he is and we know what ability he has but in terms of the go get it, want it factor, want it bad factor, max. I'm not sure that's always been the case with Kawhi Land and a matter of fact, I take it back, I am sure that has not always been the case with Kawhi Land. Now you're playing in a system offense. You had Tim Duncan there with Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. I understand it, but nevertheless, I'm still looking at what you've done and how badly you wanted it as opposed to just going along to get along and doing your job. I'm sorry, James Harden is more valuable than that. I'm looking at a Steph-Curry, the greatest shooter in the world. You talk about ball movement, Max-Kellerman. You talk about how people have to change things around Maxman. I got news for you who led the league in assists last year. Not this past season, last season when he was running up for league MVP. That would be James Harden. Do you know that, that Steph-Curry has a career average of 6.8 assists per game. He's the greatest shooter in the world. We know he can score. We know how big time he is, et cetera, et cetera. Steph-Curry averaged 30 in 2015, 2016 this past season, he averaged 26. We know how surreal Steph-Curry is but James Harden has never averaged less than 25 a game since he arrived in Houston after being a reserve in OKC James Harden has averaged 30 the last two years. James Harden averaged 29 and 29 the last two seasons before averaging 30 this year. Do you also know that James Harden gets to the free throw line, an average of 10 games the last four years, the last four years and five of the last six years, he gets to the free throw line. So we're talking about a cat that could shoot, we're talking about a cat that can dance on. You get to the hole. Nobody can guard him one on one. He can get his shot in the paint whenever he wants. He's a south wall, he's a lefty, he can shoot threes, he can get to the hole."
12,"Welcome to the Undisputed podcast. I'm your host, Joy Taylor. We've got a packed show today, Skip Shannon. Let's get to it. Good morning fellas. Oh, you, you decided to wear blue like Ebony, huh? We called each other that we figured it out. Both of you beat you down on Friday to go beat Ebony down to you down to date you feeling paranoid. You should. How are you? We good. Here we go. How you doing? I'm lovely. Had a great weekend. Had a nice dinner. Wonderful, wonderful. What's wrong with you? Skip? All right, fellas. We're gonna start this morning with LeBron James. Now he definitely knows how to make an entrance. Ron Braun showed up at the Lakers Summer League game yesterday to a standing ovation. Then he sat courtside wearing purple and gold Laker shorts. He also hugged his new teammate, Brandon Ingram and even chatted with Ty Lou after the game. Now, lebron's new boss, Magic johnson was full of compliments for the king calling him, quote the greatest leader in sports, huge, huge statement. Shannon Sharp. Do you agree with that? LeBron James says I'm out here living my best life. I'm living my best life. He worried about you. He's looking oddly skinny to me. No, he's not saying that. I don't know why. Go ahead. Four years. I would have to agree with magic. Although leadership is something that's very, very hard to quantify. Uh and people you fall into two camps, maybe if you like Jordan and, and Kobe's leadership style, some people scale up if that they ride you, kick you in the butt, some guys pick you up, bring you along. So guys, I'm gonna really need you today. I'm gonna get you. Uh especially in basketball. I'm gonna try and get you involved, but I'm gonna take Magic johnson at his Magic Johnson was one of the all time great leaders in, in pro sports history, obviously to become the entrepreneur and the businessman that he did, obviously, he had to become a great leader outside of the realm of sports. So he knows what a great leader both in basketball and in the uh uh the business world uh would equate to I think what makes uh uh LeBron such a great leader skip is that and I'm sure tom Brady, you can throw his name into this hat. But what Brian, what separates Ron I think is that we knew what he was able to do for seven years in Cleveland. Then he takes his show on the road and goes to Miami and he's also a great leader. There goes to four straight finals. Two final wins. Two of them, two mvps goes back to Cleveland, goes to four more finals, uh, wins another title. So we, we've seen it over the course of his, uh, his body of work over 15 years. He would be a great leader in a lot of different locations. We have yet to see what type of leader Tom Brady would beat skip if he's not in New England. If he doesn't have coach Belichick, I think you have to wear the weigh those into the mix because we've only seen him at one locale. We've only seen him with one head coach basically with one owner where LeBron James has moved around and granted that's by his own fruition. I I, you know, but you look at what he's been able to accomplish and you look at some of the teams that he's been able to take places that I do not believe. And a lot of other people do not believe they could have gone without him. It's hard to disagree with what magic said again. Leadership is something really, really hard to quantify. But guys and people that are great leaders normally know what another great leader looks like. And if Magic Johnson says this, I'm willing to take magic at his word. So this is a very difficult question for me because you know how much I love me. Some Magic johnson, my love for magic is just barely s to my love from Michael Jordan. And yet to me, Magic was an even greater leader than Michael was, he wasn't a greater player, but he was a greater leader and, and leadership was part and parcel of magic's greatness. He, he, you can say he had all these Hall of Famers around. I, I'm not sure how great great that team would have been without him being the driving force, the unifier, the igniter. It was showtime because it was winning time because of that guy Magic Johnson. So this is difficult for me because in, in basketball, if we just keep it right in basketball, he's the greatest leader ever. He's, he's your Ray Lewis in a very different package than Ray was Michael Jordan to your point, motivated by fear just by aura just, just by, he's gonna pop Steve Kerr in the mouth and practice if he doesn't like the way he's coming at it. People up. He is and he's, he's liable to grab you right around your throat in the locker room right before tipoff and say you will give me 15 points and seven rebounds or whatever he needs from you in your life. Yes, sir."

14,"People are so mad about like monetization and stuff. Let's talk about that youtubers. You have no power. How many times do you poop a day? Um How about you guys? Have you guys ever seen a Ghost? I to that, I didn't believe in ghost at all because I was scared for a long time after that clap. I would say, OK, you roll, it's rolling. Yeah, I would say introduce people first and then talk about the podcast. Welcome back or welcome to the very first or second episode because we don't know if we're gonna post, post that first test podcast. Uh We are here with David Choi, special guest from because I was with my mic. It'll probably get captured. I want that sound in there in 321. No, I don't like that. You got to calm down way cooler than that. OK. So we are here with, damn it. We're here with David Choi. Hey, you wanna start over and we will, who is also working as the uh what is that guy called? The technical, technical sound designer, sound engineer, but he's not engineering things. I'm literally just looking, he's pressing, I'm pressing record of what David set up for. David put together this audio setup for us, but he doesn't, he says we need better. Doesn't everyone sound so crispy and clean? We do sound pretty crispy, but he says we also need a lot. We're missing a lot of things. So I have not, I have high standards. I will say that you're audio guy, of course, you do. You got to do the best with what you've got. Um, I didn't have, we should probably come prepared next time probably. Or we could just do what we did last time and just hope, you know, what kind of things do people normally do? The podcast you listen to, what do they normally talk about? Because the ones I listen to are super random. They just like flow, they talk about anything. Well, the ones I listen to usually have a theme structure and a theme or like topics that they want to talk about. But I've also heard the ones where people just flow. I like flow. Hey, we gotta get some sponsors though. We need some, we need some better equipment. That's what David told us. Let's talk about this allergy. Like, how long have you had these allergies for? I never, well, this is literally, I've never had allergies my whole life and since last year, around this time of year, for whatever reason I developed them, it, it sucks. It's strange how, when you age you start developing these things. You start to die, everyone's dying. You know what's crazy? It's such a simple concept. But like we're all dying right now. Everybody from the moment you're born, you're dying. That's deep. I think you're growing and then you die, you're always dying. No one lives forever. But the brain cell thing, like you start losing brain cells when you're constantly losing cells. I hear that it keeps growing and multiplying until a certain age. That's when it stops multiplying, then it starts losing, losing brain cells. But technically, even as a baby don't B cells die and, but they grow at a faster rate. So it's always growing. But you're always also dying. I mean, I think humanity is dying. What humanity is definitely dying. Damn. This turned dark really dark, like with all the stuff on the internet these days. I agree that's going on. Yeah. You know what? Let's be dark today. Yeah, it's ok to be dark. I think it's, I think people are, are really afraid of death and they shouldn't be afraid to talk about it. Yeah. You know, like, um people in Mexico, they celebrate death. Dia de La Muertos. Dia de Los Muer. That's a real thing. Yeah, they celebrate death. Like you look at Coco movie. I didn't watch it but I saw some elements of the Day of Death. That's what that's about. I don't heard that movie is really good of it. We shouldn't be talking about. Should we give a review on Coco? We all didn't see it. So, I thought that the animation was amazing. Do you think people do that? Yeah. All the time. It's just like giving a book report like you go to, I don't know what voice that was. It's like, yelp ratings. It makes it, it's crazy how much Yelp. Or like rotten tomatoes can affect people when it's just one that's kind of dangerous if you think about it. Because what if, because people already manipulated. Yelp. Right. Like, isn't there like some big, like, a lot of politics in Yelp with Yelp? If you have a restaurant and you get bad ratings, you can pay Yelp to get rid of some of those, which is like, that should be legal. But it's a privately owned company. Right. Yes, it is. Private. Yeah. So, yeah, they can do that. Same with you. So, that's a whole another topic we're getting on to. But, yeah, same with youtube. People are so mad about, like, monetization and stuff. Let's talk about that because this actually relates to."
15,"All right. Well, let's get this thing started. Hello, everybody, whoever's on the call, pleasure to, to talk to you. And we welcome you to uh our uh conference call here today. The uh the goal of this conference call is to update shareholders and investors on where we're going as a company and uh talk about the new era of next year. And uh and many other things that are very exciting to come. Uh Before we start, I'd like to introduce our team. Um First of all, I'd like to introduce you to uh Howard Bloomberg, who is the chief operating officer for an XCO. And I'd like to introduce you to Miriam Metcalf. Uh Miriam is the Chief financial Control officer for NM. Um I would like to introduce you to John-Acunto. John was the CEO and president of 212. He is now the Chief technology officer for no. Um Mark Gusterson is the Chief Financial Officer for no uh Lauren uh sekora is on the phone as well. She's a VP of marketing. Uh Reese is head of social media and cynthia Kar has come on as our Chief strategy officer. If I miss anybody. No. All right, perfect. So let's get this thing started. Um We're really excited about where we are today. Uh One of the best things that has happened to this company in quite some time is the fact that we just acquired uh Q 12, which I'm sure the majority of the shareholders are very, very excited about. And so are we, what this does is it creates a brand new opportunity for NCO One to expand on its uh its ability to one procure revenue. And also it opens up new opportunities for than the software, which is where we started. Uh in regards to our expansion. Um Today, you'll be able to see uh our product Vioware, which is the user, we're gonna show you today, uh which is what we were allowing people to know about and also to uh show that we're moving in a different direction. Um A lot of we release press on that and we wanted people to know that we got something brand new. And essentially this product is uh is what we call swept it, uh changes the way that people interact with technology. Um So that is something that we will be talking about today and how we plan to use it, why we developed it. And um and we'll be talking about some other software development as well. So let's talk about the future of the company, Nicki's new platform is, well, I, I don't want to say it's new, our platform has always been convergence, but we're moving just in a different direction. Uh And we're doing convergence with software now. So when we show you some of the things that we're doing, I think I have a better understanding of why we, why we're doing what we're doing and why we're calling this a brand new era. So a couple of things that have been new in the company, we've got a lot of brand new investors. Um We have brand new shareholders in the company by two and two. And these opportunities also present us with some new things we never had before. Uh With the fact that two and two was a, was had 70 million $80 million invested in that company. And along with that came a number of very high end uh investors. Um This opened the door for Nyxio to capitalize on these things and present ourselves to the market as a new, a new company. Um The future of our company is primarily software. Uh Granted, we do have wonderful hardware. Everybody knows that we presented the best TV in the market. Um We have shown that we're first in the market literally with everything that we've done. Our biosphere product is now selling, we have a brand new manufacturer associated with that. Um And we'll be, we'll continue to bring out new hardware. It's not that we're setting aside our hardware. It's that we're adding more things in our hardware category. As we move forward with our software on the software side, we're going down two different paths. One, we're offering a software that we've been working on that is an operating system behind N OS uh brand new user interface, which is called Vioware. That's vioware. Along with that, we'll be developing apps which we'll talk a little bit about more and uh and a couple of other things I think are going to be very, very exciting. Let's talk about the acquisition of 212 to, to play gig product. We're not gonna, we're gonna be showing you a little bit of that later. And, uh, the rock, this was its first in the market in regards to social media and music. It's a, it's an amazing product and there are a number of reasons why we call it amazing. But I want you to keep one thing in mind when we're talking about Nick Show as a company."
16,"Thank you. Good afternoon. And thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple Ceo Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin operating expenses, other income and expense taxes, capital allocation, share, repurchase dividends and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently f filed periodic reports on form 10-K and form 10-Q and the form eight K filed with the SEC today along with the Associated-Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Thank you, Nancy and to everyone joining us, welcome. We're proud to announce the results of a very successful quarter today, setting new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings. We generated $61.1 billion of revenue. That's up 16% from last year making it our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based with iPhone revenue up 14% services up 31% and wearables up almost 50%. We grew in each of our geographic segments and in greater China and Japan revenue was up more than 20%. Iphone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half with $100 billion in iPhone revenue. An increase of $12 billion over last year setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years. IPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDCs. Latest estimates for the global smartphone market and customers chose iPhone 10 more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Since we split the line with the launch of iPhone six and six plus in 2014. This is the first cycle in which the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular Q two was our best quarter ever for services and momentum. There continues to be incredibly strong revenue topped $9 billion for the first time. Up more than $2 billion. Over last year's March quarter, we had all time record revenue from the App Store from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay and more all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers across all our services paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million of over 100 million from a year ago and up 30 million in the last 90 days alone contributing to the overall increase in services revenue. Apple pay continues its strong growth with active users more than doubling and transactions, tripling year over year, we believe the availability of of Apple pay at major transit systems have been a key driver of adoption among commuters. And in March, we launched express transit with Apple Pay in Beijing and Shanghai, the 2nd and 3rd largest transit systems in the world. Apple Pay is already the most successful mobile transit payment system in Tokyo which has the busiest transit system of all with the launch of Brazil in April. Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets and we expect Norway Poland and Ukraine to launch in the next several months. This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business which includes Apple watch beats and airpods with combined revenue of almost 50% year over year. Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters. Our wearables business is now the size of a fortune 300 company."
18,"Jan, I'll have you kick-off the first question. Um What is your short list? And this is written from the question was written from the perspective of a project leader. But as a team member, um short list of tasks, key tasks that um you'd like to accomplish in your first meeting with, with your AC team. And most of you will have your first meeting with your A T team today. So we thought this would be a highly relevant uh question. So I think there are three parts to that three key tasks and one, if you, if you look at page 76 and seven of your act volunteer handbook, I put a little square around team kick-off meeting, which is, you know, step number 12 or 13 for a project. By the time, you know, our team kicks off on bios design, a lot of things will have happened already. There have been conversations internally conversations with the client, a plan of a draft plan developed and my first recommendation would be is get everyone up to speed on everything that's happened to date. I have been on a project where it was sort of, yeah, I talked to the board member and he said that's what we wanted and that's what we're gonna do. It's like, well, it's sort of like the train has already left the station and you're running to get on it. So I encourage team leaders to walk through everything that, you know, the, the piece of paper that April 1st got that, the client sent in to every conversation that's happened and an org chart would be great. Here's who I've talked to with the organization. Here's what their position is. Here's what they said. Um Our bios design team even has a better way of doing this. Uh dave Plow, plow, plow is leading it. The clients coming to our first kickoff meeting, he's gonna be there for 30 minutes talking about the organization, why there's a project at all and then he's leaving and then we're having our meeting. So getting everyone up to speed is the, the first thing I'd recommend at the tail of the meeting I think is also a sort of an easy thing to that. That's pretty easy to understand. The tail of the meeting is also pretty easy to understand. And I'll talk about the middle last, the tail is sort of what we all did at MBA school, which is, you know, OK, there's a team, there's a, you know, there's a sub team, there's a sub team, there's a sub team, ideally, it's two on a sub team or three so that if one drops off, you still have someone and there's also pairing of someone who's really skilled in that area and someone who's learning uh a particular thing that they might not know as much about. Um one small point on this one. I'm sort of a data wonk on teams is that I'd like there to be sort of a data plan in place and talked about at the early days because it's often the hardest thing to get one project uh that I was on for the Y MC A. We wanted payroll data that didn't come until, you know, four weeks before the end of the project. And we finally had something to say, oh, this is OK. Now, you know, now we know that your turnover rates aren't too high. So I think that's generally true in consulting as the data takes a while. So I left. I, that's the front and the back the middle is, um I think it would be helpful for team leaders to walk through the, the work plan and talk about. Well, let me back up the, I, I would wanna know as a joining a team leader, sort of take me through all the elements of the organization that you know about. What's the mission, what are they trying to do? How are they financed? Uh Whatever the team leader thought about in advance and coming up with the work plan, what the client asked for clearly. And then to go through, here's what my thinking is on the work plan and why, you know, I think it's this kind of problem. This is a funding problem or for bios design. You know, I, I'll give you two examples for bios, uh, what I have read and I've only read the summary and the, the, uh, what was marketed to volunteers is that they've sort of accomplished their mission and they're looking for what to do next. Well, that could mean either they don't know what to do next or they don't know where the money is gonna come to for what they're gonna do next, or there's no demand in the university for what's what they're doing. Or it could mean a lot of different things and I'd want the team leader to explain exactly sort of the underlying reason that we're working on that thing. That's the beginning, middle end. I would just add that. I think it's worthwhile very early in your effort to sit down and spend time together, understanding what, you know, collectively and what you don't know because you have an academic expertise, uh, may have been your concentration of coursework, you have the expertise that you have and what you do for a living. But then there's a whole another thing which is like real world experience, which turns out to be pretty valuable and unless you understand where your holes are as well as where your strengths are you may duplicate efforts or end up not having the expertise that you need in a project. I have to add something to that can't have just."
19,"So um let's go round the table and just have a sort of high level snapshot for my, everyone else's where the major subsystems are. James main control. Well, we've been working on the order flip flops for a number of weeks and have ended up with a list of requirements which they need to conform to the flashing units. And we've been liaising with John, the flashing units. The mono stables are uh complicated in their behavior. Um But Tom and Simon have done in-depth studies and um they feel confident that uh they can be made to work and give us all the uh behaviors that we need. There's an issue with noisy signals from Zac leaking through and gates for the set signal and those have to be cleaned up. Um Then there's an issue with how long you have to wait until you can set the flip flop again after a reset. But we're talking with john in detail about the exact requirement there. It seems that we do have a period of grace during which uh da is seeking the next order and there's a, there's a minimum at least two minor cycles, isn't there so, and it could be a lot longer because it, it uh it depends where the order is in the tank, but the minimum is two on the next iteration around, we can bore you for as long as you want. With the details of this. We have, we have a list of 11 requirements which I think define what's needed. And then Tom and Simon will produce electronics that meet that. We'll have a drill down on that once we, we can do 10. But in fact, we can do all of them, but not all level sims' is a kind of broader, deeper question. Um The Monos Stables are not easy to work with. Their behavior is a bit cranky. And then Tom says no. And then we ii I did a survey of the historical diagrams uh that were found. And by 1952 quite a number of the flip flops on, on those collection of diagrams that we have. And we don't know that, that, that is a representative sample. Yeah, we don't know what, what kind of sample it is. Um The great majority of flip flops had been uh change the Buy Stables. It, we don't know that they were Monos Stables to begin with, but certainly by 1952 they're shown as B Stables. Now, whether that's because, um, they felt those were more reliable or easier to work with. I don't know. So there is that kind of question if we continue to have difficulties with mono stables if um there is that possible option of changing them to B staples but the bar stable, that's in the documentation. The historical diagrams does rely on a minus 200 volt rail to buy us the grids that's to force one of the valves off strongly. Um Tom and I have produced a bistable for the operator's control unit which doesn't need the minus 200 volt road. It achieves the biasing by raising the cathode with the bias so that there is a relative grid to cathode bias to force one of the valves off. Um Anyway, that long ramble is the question is if we, if we were to continue having difficulties with monos staples, then we might not. Um it may raise the question of rethinking some at least of the monastery. Ok. So let's put that on the agenda for deeper discussion and we, we've gone round the table. Ok. Thanks James john. Anything from coincidence is fully working as far as I'm concerned. It's sitting there waiting to be used to be stimulated from the main control. Um How is it running in various modes? Are sitting at the dress zero or turning up through the various"
2,"We are getting reports that 11 people have been rescued. Each of them remember has to be pulled through the cave by expert divers. It is such a risky and complicated operation. So let's take you straight there to Ta Nan, our correspondent Dan johnson is there. Uh and Dan signs of ambulances with sirens going tell us what you've witnessed in the past few minutes or so. Yes, 1/9 ambulance just left here and headed away down the road, taking another of the boys to hospital. So that's a sign that the rescue mission that was restarted again this morning is continuing in a successful way. And we understand that further up that road by the cave entrance, there are two more boys who have been brought to the surface and are just being checked over. They will be put into ambulances shortly and driven away to hospital too. So that would mean there's only one more boy and their 25 year old coach left in the cave still to be rescued. We understand that rescue operation is underway. The officials in charge said this morning that they were confident in the experience that they have gained over the last two days of bringing these boys out that they could complete this rescue operation today and make sure that everyone is safe. But even when the boys and their coach are out, there are still other people to follow. There's a doctor who's been in there treating them for the last few days. He has to be brought to safety along with three of the Royal Thai Navy divers who were the first team to actually reach the boys eight days ago. Now, they were the ones who discovered them alive deep on that hillside in the furthest depths of that. Cain and those three navy divers have been with them for the last eight days. So they themselves as part of the rescue team have now gone through something of an ordeal and everyone's aware that they have to be brought to safety too. So it looks like this rescue operation is now reaching a conclusion and it's so far been thoroughly successful. Let's hope that continues indeed, Dan as each of the boys come out and there is news of that. What is the atmosphere like? Do you feel the sort of growing sense of euphoria there that this has all gone so well? Yes, you can feel the tension being shed off in layers with each ambulance that comes out with each confirmation we get that another boy is safe and is on his way to hospital. Now, some of the parents have been keeping a vigil up by the cave entrance. Ever since this ordeal started. 18 days ago, most of those were moved to the main town to Chiang Rai a couple of days ago when officials said this rescue attempt was going to begin. So they're waiting at the hospital, although they haven't been able to be reunited yet, even with the boys who are already safe, there are lots of safety checks, health checks to be carried out to make sure those boys are all right to assess exactly what impact this ordeal has had on their physical well-being and their mental health as well. So everyone knows that there is a lot more still to do, but the relief is certainly pouring across the fields here that are covered in the world's media because the eyes of everyone around the globe have been on the of that cave waiting for these boys to emerge. Well, it looks like we don't have to wait much longer until they're all out. Indeed, Dan. I wonder if those boys who have been rescued, just realize how many people have been watching the entrance to this cave, wishing them well from all over the world, we know one of them has asked for chocolate, which seemed to me to be a great sign. Do we know if any of them have been talking yet about their experiences about what they've actually been through as they were brought out of the cave? We were told this morning by the medics who are in charge treating them that the boys, the eight who are in hospital overnight are all sat up and are responsive. We've not been told much about what they've been saying. But as you say, some of them have been asking for their favorite food. They may not be able to have that yet because, uh, their digestive systems have to be readjusted, having not eaten properly for more than two weeks. They didn't eat at all really, for 10 days while they were stuck alone in darkness. And they've only really had soft food drinks and, uh, protein gels over the last few days. And even once they're out, they can't just start eating solid food again. So I'm not sure the chocolate request will be fulfilled any time soon and they're not even allowed their favorite spicy food yet. It's going to take some time for these boys to get back to normality. After what they've been through, we can't see them through the windows of the ambulances which are blacked out, but we don't know if they see us and that might be the first glimpse they get of the line of cameras that is here, bringing these pictures to people around the world, letting the world know that they are finally safe after everything they've been through. I'm sure they'll get an appreciation of that over the next few days. They have an invite to the World Cup final FIFA has said there are seats there for them if they can get to safety and if they feel up to it, but the medics this morning said they, at least a week in hospital, they're weakened after what they've been through, they've lost weight. They've got all sorts of different ways in which they need to readjust after this. So I don't think we'll see them at the World Cup. The doctor said they'll be watching it on TV though because they are a football team. That's the passion that brought them together. They went in that cave as a team and hopefully by the end of today they'll be reunited even if it is in hospital. It's great to have such good news, Dan."
21,"So this actually um came from Amanda. So she texted me this week and she had questions basically and like all the questions that we all go through at the beginning. Um And one that really stood out to me that, that I've kind of been like, um people have been talking to me about um I don't know, it must be like a theme right now but basically how to get over the fear, how to get over the fear of not wanting to be salesy or just not wanting to, you know, be that person um When you're just starting out. Yeah. And I wrote down a couple of things cause looking back, I mean, we're all at different stages and, and that's really awesome. Like that's, that's why, you know, we partner and we, we go in this together because some people grow at different rates and some people are in different stages of their lives and some people, you know, like, like have kids and are doing the whole thing and um and that's the best because we can all bring a different perspective into our businesses. Yeah. So I just did like ac I just have five points here because it's really like, it is really straightforward and the, the moment that you can kind of get out of your own way and get out of your head and, and start, like, really feeling into your business being the confident person that you are. That's when things start rolling a little bit quicker for you. And you're not just like spinning your wheels, hoping, hoping and using hope to get anywhere. Yeah. Yes, because hope is not a game plan. No, you can love your oils. You can like as you're starting out, like you can love your oils and be super passionate about the idea of building this business. But if you aren't stepping daily into fear and sharing your heart daily, you really aren't doing this as a business. So my first point is say, hey, to fear, that's all you have to do when fear like fear is boring. We hear like that. We hear leaders talk about um how boring fear is all the time and like how when you step into your fear and through fear, that's when you connect with your freedom on the other side. So the whole point of this when you're when you're first starting out and when you come up into a situation, maybe, you know, with an aunt or with your close friends or family, know that your family is probably the are the last people to get on board. Like those people you just have to like, step into your own confidence and be like, hey, this is what I'm using for this and it's really worked awesome for me. Like, do you wanna try it or, you know, it doesn't have to be so like, now I'm in network marketing and I sell do terra like, it doesn't have to be so weird. The more casual you can be with your own experiences and the more confidence that you can bring into your own life, that's when people start picking up on that. But that doesn't come easy like that. You have to move through layers of fear to be able to get to that. So even like just recently for me, for me, I sat beside this girl um at this concert uh that Dev and I went to in Bayfield and she was probably my age and like she was with her boyfriend too. She was wearing like super cute boots and all I had to say was like, hey, I love your boots. But like I got this like feeling in my chest and it was fear, it was fear like, oh I'm putting myself out there and what if they move seats or like what if then like were those people? And, and that was all coming from like, well, um I'm not, I wasn't feeling confident enough to be like, hey, this is what I do and like, you know, do you wanna connect? Yeah. And I regret that moment because I know that I just missed an opportunity. But now I know that the, that feeling that comes up that like sits in your chest and you're like, oh, do I speak? Do I not? Is that beer? Is that just like my own shit that I have to move through? That is the moment where you're like, hey, I love your boots. Yeah. And then who knows what will happen from there? Maybe she'll just be like, thanks so much and then that's it. Or maybe, or maybe you can use that as a stepping stone and, and take it one step further. But if you never say, hey, I like your boots and move the layer of beer, you're never gonna connect with anyone. And this business is about connecting."

This recording is by Mark Smith of Simpsonville, South Carolina. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle adventure one, a scandal in Bohemia to Sherlock Holmes. She is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes. She eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler, all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was I take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen. But as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position, he never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer, excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own, delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his metal results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high-powered lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late Irene Adler of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness and the home-centered interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment was sufficient to absorb all my attention. While Holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time. I heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee and finally, of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the Daily press. I knew little of my former friend and companion. One night it was on the 20th of March 1888 I was returning from a journey to a patient for I had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers, his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as I looked up, I saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own, his manner was not effusive. It seldom was, but he was glad I think to see me with hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye. He waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner."
23,"There is a world that's been out of reach until now. Two seas lie on either side of Saudi Arabia. One sea is beautiful flamboyant and sophisticated. The other is across the desert. A younger sea secretive, tougher differently. Little in these two sister seas is as it appears. This is a story of miracles where you would least expect them. The two seas reach around the desert peninsula of Arabia like two arms millions of years ago. This was underwater on the sea floor. A deep compost built up. It's still here hidden under the sand as oil. The wealth of a long-gone sea now fuels our world. The natural riches of the past as well as the present are part of this story. 10,000 years ago, the Gulf was a swampy flood plain when the sea level rose, it disappeared underwater. The Red Sea was formed much earlier as Africa and Arabia's tectonic plates pulled apart leaving a chasm a mile deep now filled the seawater, the edges fringed with coral disappear into the depths. The reef is a jeweled city perched on the cliff top. It's a community with amazing relationships between animals, five centimeter rass groomed sweet lips, even combing the tender gills, they eat any parasites and dead skin. A reward for their trouble. The moray eel, the 2.5 m dragon of the reef is attended by shrimps. They enter the jaws of death to keep razor-sharp teeth clean in exchange for any morsels. They find no opportunity is wasted. However desperate it may seem damselfish, hide in an anemone protected by tentacles that would paralyze other fish and anemic and clothes. And the local clownish is finding his home a tight squeeze. Every relationship can have difficult moments. This underwater community lies along the shores of ancient human settlements. The Middle East is the birthplace of our civilization. Over 4000 years ago, the first cities rose here, the cradle of mathematics, astronomy and medicine. If the Garden of Eden's rivers flowed anywhere, it was into the Gulf Ancient Mesopotamia was on the northern shoreline with Persia to the east."
24,"This is a LibriVox recording. All LibriVox recordings are in the public domain recording by Moira Fogarty. The Art of War by Sun Tzu, translated by Lionel Giles. Part one laying plans. Sun Tzu said the art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence, it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account, be neglected. The art of war then is governed by five constant factors to be taken into account in one's deliberations when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. These are one, the moral law, two heaven three, earth four, the Commander five method and discipline. The moral law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler so that they will follow him regardless of their lives undismayed by any danger. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat times and seasons. Earth comprises distances, great and small danger and security, open ground and narrow passes. The chances of life and death. The commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness by method and discipline are to be understood, the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army and the control of military expenditure. These five heads should be familiar to every general. He who knows them will be victorious. He who knows them not will fail. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison in this wise one which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the moral law. Two, which of the two generals has most ability, three, with whom lie. The advantages derived from heaven and earth. Four, on which side is discipline most rigorously enforced. Five which army is stronger. Six on which side are officers and men more highly trained. Seven in which army is there, the greater constancy, both in reward and punishment by means of these seven considerations, I can forecast victory or defeat the general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it will conquer. Let such a one be retained in command, the general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it will suffer defeat. Let such a one be dismissed while heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules according as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans. All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable. When using our forces, we must seem inactive when we are near. We must make the enemy believe we are far away. When far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out bates to entice the enemy feign disorder and crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him, pretend to be weak that he may grow arrogant if he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them, attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected. These military devices leading to victory must not be divulged beforehand. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple. Ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory and few calculations to defeat how much more no calculation at all. It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose. End of part one part two waging war. Suns said in the operations of war where there are in the field, 1000 swift chariots, as many heavy chariots and 100,000 mail-clad soldiers with provisions enough to carry them. 1000 li the expenditure at home and at the front including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint and some spent on chariots and armor will reach the total of 1000 ounces of silver per day."
25,"The year is 15 ce and the Roman Empire is prospering. Most of the credit will go to the emperor. But this success wouldn't have been possible without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix. Servius enlisted as a legionary eight years ago. At age 18, the son of a poor farmer with few prospects, unlike the majority of legionaries, he doesn't gamble. So he's been able to save most of his wages. He's even kept his viaticum, the three gold coins he received when he enlisted. If he survives until retirement, he'll receive several acres of land and he's grown rather fond of a girl back home whom he intends to marry, but he'll have to wait until he completes his 25 years of service before that can happen. And the life of a legionary is dangerous and grueling today, Servius legion along with three others has undertaken a great march of 30,000 Roman paces, the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers Servius armor and weapons including his Gladius scutum and two pilla weigh over 20 kg. And that's not counting his backpack or Sarcina which contains food and all the tools he needs to help build the camp Spade saw pickaxe and basket. Although Servius is exhausted, he won't sleep much tonight. He's been assigned the first watch, which means looking after the baggage animals and keeping alert against a possible ambush. After he's done, he lies awake dreading the day ahead, which will force him to recall his worst nightmare at dawn. Sergios eats breakfast with his seven tent companions. They're like a family, all bearing scars from the battles they fought together. Sergio is from Italia but his fellow soldiers hail from all over the empire which stretches from Syria to Spain. So they're all far from home in the northern land of Germania. Ctu's legion and three others with him today are under the command of Emperor Tiberius's nephew Germanicus, named for his father's military successes against the Germanic tribes. Each legion has close to 5000 men divided into cohorts of about 500 further subdivided into centuries of around 80 to 100 men. Each century is commanded by a centurion, an aquifer or eagle-bearer marches at the head of each legion carrying its eagle standard. The centurions march beside the legionnaires, belting out orders, decks, sin decks, sin, right left, right left, starting with the right foot as the left is considered unlucky or sinister. Despite the strict discipline, there's tension in the air last year, some legions in the area revolted, demanding better pay and a cut in the length of service. Only their general's charisma and negotiating skills prevented wholesale mutiny. Today is a just march only 30 kilometers as the marshes and forests of Germania lie beyond the empire's road system. The men must build causeways and bridges to make headway something they've recently spent more time doing than fighting. Finally, they arrive at their destination. A place. Servius knows too well. It's a clearing on the outskirts of the Tuber forest where six years ago during the reign of the Emperor Augustus Germanic tribes under their chieftain, Arminius ambushed and destroyed three legions, proceeding along a narrow path. The legions were attacked from forest cover under torrential rain with their escape blocked. It was one of the worst defeats the Romans ever suffered and Augustus never lived it down. Servius was one of the few survivors. Serio still has nightmares of his comrades lying where they fell. But now the army is back to bury the dead with full military honors. As he helps in the task, he can't help wondering whether the bones he handles belonged to someone he knew several times he wants to weep aloud, but he pushes on with the task. The glory of the empire can go to the crows. All he craves is to retire on a small farm with his wife-to-be. If the gods should spare his life for 17 more years.

26,"If you're like me, you probably have a smartphone in your pocket. It's easy to forget how incredible it is that one little device can do so many things like taking pictures at one point. You needed a special camera loaded with light-sensitive film to take a photo. And if you didn't know what you were doing, all of your pictures would be ruined. But nowadays, you can take hundreds of selfies with just the tap of your finger. The digital camera inside your phone is doing the heavy lifting. Thanks to some feats of electrical engineering, digital cameras don't see images. The way we do to them. A picture is just a series of ones and zeros. So when you take a selfie, the first thing your phone has to do is change light into electronic data that it can understand. Light comes in packets of energy called photons and to generate an image, a digital camera needs to figure out how many photons are reflecting off your face and coming through the lens and how much energy those photons have to do that. Digital cameras usually have an image sensor called a complementary metal oxide semiconductor, also known as a CMOS sensor, there's a good chance that this is what's in your phone camera or in a DSLR A CMA sensor is mostly made up of layers of silicon, which is a semiconductor semiconductors. Let you control electrical conductivity or how easily electrons can move through a material. They're usually materials with chemical impurities mixed in. So they don't conduct electricity as well as metals, but they're more conductive than an insulator like plastic. The CMOS sensor, your phone is made up of a grid of picture elements known as pixels. So when you take a selfie, a photon reflects off your face flies into the camera and hits a pixel in the CMOS sensor. When the photon hits a silicon atom in a pixel, the atom absorbs the photon's energy and its electrons become excited. And if the photon transfers enough energy, one of those excited electrons will get spit out. This creates a charge in that particular pixel which the camera measures and interprets as brightness, the more photons that hit a pixel, the stronger the charge and the brighter that pixel gets now on their own, all these pixels can detect as brightness, any picture they would take would be black and white. Adding color means there's another piece to this technology puzzle like paint light has three primary colors. In this case, red, green and blue. By mixing them together in different amounts, you can create any other visible color. So to make a color photo. A digital has to measure how much red green and blue light is hitting the sensor at each pixel rather than measuring all photons that are hitting each pixel. There are a couple of ways to do this. But one common system called a Bayer array involves layering colored filters over groups of four pixels, one red, one blue and two green. The array uses two green pixels because our eyes are especially sensitive to green wavelengths of light with a Bayer array. Each pixel can absorb energy for one of the three primary colors of light and become charged. Once the sensor has measured the charges created at each pixel, the camera has to interpret all that color and brightness information to generate an image. There's a lot that goes into this. But one important step is called de-mosaicing. Basically, the camera needs to blend the primary colors together. Otherwise every pixel would be either pure red green or blue. De-mosaicing involves some guesswork like how much blue light would have hit a nearby green. Engineers and mathematicians have several methods to calculate this. But most involve algorithms that compare nearby pixels to each other and average out their values. Thanks to this process and some more computing power, your phone will display a picture on its screen. But if there's something you want to do with it, like say post it to Instagram, there's often one more step, the image file needs to be compressed. See digital cameras collect a lot of data very quickly. And if you want to send your picture over for the internet, you usually want to make it smaller. There are lots of different algorithms for compressing images. But the one you'll see most often on the web was developed by the joint photographic experts group or JPEG JPEG compression divides the pictures up into eight by eight blocks of pixels and simplifies the information needed to describe them. Compression isn't always perfect. Larger blocks can lose too much detail and make the image pixelated while smaller blocks will preserve more information. But the file size will still be pretty big. But to social media sites which have to pay to store all those selfies, you post small files are more important. So thanks to a lot of technology working together in less than a second, your phone can turn light energy into a digital signal piece that signal together and compress it into a neat little package.

27,"Mhm. OK. Well, hello guys, welcome to our first recorded meeting. Um So I guess we could talk about the organization that we're going to be working with, which is, which is Alpha, the Association of Latino Professionals in accounting and finance or finance. And basically their problem is is that like they have a committee of member relations that like recruits people, but like that committee is no longer, they don't have that committee anymore because last semester, the committee, like the deputy, basically the runner of the committee was lacking. So like his leadership skills are lacking. So that calls like everyone in the committee to like, you know, just not be committed. So now they don't have a committee. So like they have a lot of trouble recruiting members. So all their members that are on Alpha are like existing members. Like they don't have any like, and that's like they used to be the largest organization but that's causing them not being because they don't have anyone. And that's obviously a problem in the long. Yeah, if you have an answer to as you can when you went. So basically, since I'm a member of Alpha I went to their, they, they invited me to their committee and I observed some of their problems and I took like notes. So basically, um one of the problems was that they weren't, they were focused on events that were only in the business school. Like all their events were only held in the business. I understand they're like a business school committee. But like, they should be more diverse. Like, like, for example, fresh, some freshman don't even have courses in the business school in my first semester. I didn't, I never came to the business school. So they said that I feel like their problem is that like, they need to maybe have like their big sales and robes in or like there's some other events or like even advertise, they don't advertise in robes. Their all their advertisement is only in the business because the business school is so far off-campus anyway. Like sometimes people don't even want to travel all the way over here just to attend a meeting. So it would definitely be really good for them to be in the center of campus that way they're more easily accessible. And I feel like one of the other problems that I observed was um they don't really target, like freshman and sophomores. Like they told me, like, they told me about their events and like, I, I read some of their flyers and like, it was only targeted. So it was the juniors and the seniors and I feel like some freshman needed, like they need to get going on their career earlier. So that could be because I'm, I'm actually the only freshman on Alpha then on Target, like freshman, especially like as a Sophomore, like, you need to start your internship, Sophomore. Do they provide like career experience or, or do they only focus on, like, what when you have these meetings, what else? Like, what do they talk about, like on a daily? Well, like in our meeting, they talk about like, um they said that they had a lot of information sessions, but I'm like, you know, information sessions are fun like the first two times, but they don't, they're lacking like events like, you know, like I'm a part of this other organization called NABA and they have like leadership skills events or conventions or this and that like Alpha only focuses on accounting information sessions. So they're calls accounting and finance society, but they don't have any, they don't target finance companies. So that's a problem. So someone who's a finance major might not get anything out of Alpha. So maybe that's why they like and also their meetings are about like three hours long. So if you're not committed, that's a problem. I feel like they should try and cut their meeting shorter. Wait, how frequent are they having meetings? About like every two weeks on a Friday night? So that's another problem on a Friday night. From about 630 to 9. Oh yeah. So that's like a really big problem cause I didn't even feel like sitting through the meeting. So like, you know, someone who's not 100% committing is not gonna want to dedicate 2.5 hours every other week. And also people are commuters as well. So, yeah, on a Friday night like that of other obligations. So it's kind of like just trying to meet everybody in the middle. Yeah. So those are just, like, I did write like a long list but I guess, like, throughout the semester we could target everybody but I feel like their major problems are, um, their events are a little lacking because they only have information sessions and then they're lacking like who they target, like, they only target accounting majors and not like the broad spectrum of all business majors and they're not targeting all class levels does because lack of money. No, it's just like they don't have a committee to, like, do you know, like, do the information sessions to recruit? Like, they're lacking that if any motivated people who want to get the word out. But, like, there's not that many people."
28,"Uh Doctor Chaky, I, I would ask that if you begin your presentation, if you could introduce the members of your uh Budget-Council, these people are courageous and in working with the president and with that, I'll turn the floor over to you, the president. Thank you, Agent Johnson. Thank you president. Uh I'm going to call on my uh team members. Doctor ladonna Clinton, would you please stand for a minute, please? Uh She's the Associate Vice president of Administration and by this can be assistant vice president for resource management. Laura Dey, assistant professor in the Department of Library Technical Services is Stacy Carrot who served as a resource for us. She's an associate budget director, Doctor Jeff Katz, Dean of Gordon Ford College of Business. Mr Jim Cummings, our CFO Chief Financial Officer and on the other side, Doctor Eric Reed, chair of Department of History, uh Savannah Mono, who's the vice president of SG A. She's not here. And Jennifer Miller who is our internal au audit director is also not here as a Budget-Council chair. I couldn't have asked for a better team. Uh He had c they worked hard, they were dedicated the task that was given to us was difficult and they put everything they had into that task. On behalf of the Budget-Council, I want to start out by thanking President Cabo for giving us the opportunity to work on the budget stabilization plan. Um The budget Budget-Council has existed in its current form as an informal advisory group to the president for the last 5 to 6 years. Last fall. When President Kone arrived here, he redefined the charge and reconstituted the council. Um He gave us broad latitude to come up with a comprehensive and detailed plan to not only address immediate shortfall of 15 million but also to come up with a long term way forward so that we could do well, we could succeed. As an organization, the president needs to be applauded for taking a creative and a strategic and innovative approach. He sought creativity and he specifically asked all of us to think about what's good for the institution, not necessarily what's good for our own areas of affiliation, the most pertinent cost drivers for us with the enrollment trends in each college and the bottom line fact that WKU today is a smaller institution than we were a few years ago, both in terms of the number of students we have on campus as well as the number of faculty and staff. We were tasked to do a difficult job, manage a cut. We were very deliberate in our decision making when we often revisited each decision sometimes in more than sometimes more than once. The reason for that was very simple. We wanted to be able to provide a rationale for what we were doing and why we were doing that. Um From the financial standpoint, we recognize that our task was critical to the success of this organization that we all love. However, we never lost sight of the fact that at the end of the day, there are people who are going to be impacted by the recommendations that we are going to make and the way we approach this or at least one way in which we approach this is by taking a serious look at the vacant positions. Last fall, President Caboni instituted a personnel action process that basically forced all of us, especially that committee to ask the difficult questions before hiring an a an additional employee. Can we still do our job of educating our students and addressing the safety and security and the well-being of our employees without hiring that person? And if we could, then the answer was we should not go ahead and hire a new person under the current circumstance. First, from the 30,000 ft level, our enrollments are down as our, our full time equivalent students."
29,"Jerry Mr President. How you doing, man? Well, I'm telling you, I appreciate this call so much. Congratulations. Thank you. Tell you what, this is a lot bigger deal at home than me getting elected president. I'll tell you this right now. You were an inspiration to us. I saw how to get out on a knee and come back up swinging. Thanks, man. I really appreciate this call. And I've got Jimmy standing by me. Thanks. I got somebody who want to say hi to you. Then I want to talk to Jimmy. Ok, fine. It's Ann Richards and honey, I got to listen, I got to watch the ball game in the White House with Mario Cuomo and you are wonderful. It was absolutely wonderful, dude. And let me tell you, we gave him the hardest time in the world. Well, you've answered my question. You didn't go easy on him. No, darling. We did not let our foot off his neck. Did you tell him you hadn't been the one we lost? Here's the, here's the president. You tell Emmett Smith that he's number one for me. Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Mr President. Thank you. So much for calling. I can't tell you what it means. And here's Jimmy, here's Jimmy. Hello, Mr President Jimmy. How you doing? Congratulations. Well, thank you. I think you understand how much we put into this thing and, and where we are. I, I tell you, it's a, it's a great feeling for all of our guys. Well, you come a long way in a short time and it was a lot of courage and I tell you, I, I watched the team all year long, just basically wear everybody down by hanging in there and that, it was amazing what you did. Well, you know, a little bit about perseverance yourself, so I understand. Well, I really admire what you did and this is a great night for you and I want you to get back to your players. I just wanted to say hello and we're proud of you. Ok. Thank you. Thank you a lot, Mr President. Goodbye, Jenny. Ok?"
3,"I know it's something you want to talk about and I'd be happy to do so. But let me put the bags down and get the kids some dinner and let's open the bank account and take a look in the moment. I know that's hard to do, but I'm not gonna open it. I tell him. Ok. Right. So I'm wondering about that. Do you see not see value in tracking? Do I see the value in tracking? I see the value in tracking. He can go ahead and go look and track, but I'm not going to sit there and give him an explanation of what I just purchased. So, is it your position that you're operating within the budget with these purchases? That's why I answer her. No, that's yes and no. Yes because I use my account. But at the same token, no, I don't operate the budget because it's not something that we've planned on. If we already did the groceries, then he's questioning. Well, why did you have to go back to the, to the grocery store again? So this purchase in your mind might be an extra like we already have food in the house, we already an extra. You go to the house and there's food, it might not be the food that wanna eat at that moment. There's plenty of food and that's where, you know, my growing up, my background is completely different from her. I, you know, I'm, I'm Cuban. I come from a country. I never had anything. So to me, um, correct that. Correct. Well, it's not that I didn't have anything but I didn't have everything I wanted and me growing up, I didn't have everything either. Maybe the thing to do is to view the budget as a living document. It's not something that's cut in stone, things happen and you need to have potentially weekly or monthly or quarterly meetings to revise the budget. I don't like talking. I said the budget we set the every year. Yeah. Said the budget for the year and it's got a match at December. I'll go crazy. I'm wondering if you agree that the budget is what it needs to be because of the exercise you went through in January and it was in your best interest to stay within these parameters. Ok. So if that's the agreement, then in any particular month, if for some reason and you exceeded the budget in, let's say the food area, then you have to consider that you no longer have the opportunity to do that in the following month and something has to give, maybe you don't go to the movies or maybe the kids don't have snacks and you make cookies that, that, and I'm ok with that. But then Jackie is not willing to and I get it to make the kids suffer for a bad decision. Ah, ok. Well, more emotional attachment. It has to be done on a developmentally appropriate um basis. But Children should be learning about these dec decisions. These choices knock on wood. Thank God, I know my kids they throw themselves on the floor in the shopping center if they don't get their stuff. That's one thing that we taught them. So maybe they'll understand a conversation where gee, we did all these fun things last month. This is the month we have to step back and not do those things. I think you can model that for them and you'll, you know, reap the benefits when they're older. But as jean was about to find out Jackie and Manuel's arguments about the budget are rooted in their own childhood experiences. His family was more dynamics of what the dad said. Went in my dynamics. It was more like what my dad said, went, my mom would give a little rebuttal, but then she would give in and I hated that and I would always argue with my mom. Like, why do I have to make that? Why, why do you have to go get him a glass of water? He's right next to the kitchen. I don't wanna do that I can see how this is a trigger for you. But when you think about it, do you really feel like you're not being heard? Manuel? Are you getting? Sometimes I do and he knows it because I tell him, like, every time we get to an argument about this, like every time it has to be something with money, it's my fault. And so he says, well, kind of like if the shoe fits, wear it. So you know that, but the, that's why I feel controlled. So standing up for yourself without putting your partner down is a skill that might benefit you. And it takes a lot of practice. It sounds like you have some practice from your original family where you said no, why do I need to do that? It, that's kind of what I do with him. But I, I keep telling her, you know, forget about your family. It's important to validate that this is what she's experiencing. So why am I gonna follow somebody else's mistake? Let me make my own. But when you make the mistake and I explain it to you, you don't change it. The next time we have a financial issue, it's the same thing. Well, I don't understand why did you spend so much? So, I would tell him, ok, well, then you spend a week with the kids and see how much you spend and I'll go work all day and he says, great"
30,"Hello. Hello, Justin. How are you? Hey, I'm doing pretty good. I would say it's good that you found a place to eat. Now that you're all set for lunch, uh, breakfast. Technically breakfast. Uh, it's, it's, uh, 20 past de LA. Ok. Well, when you go camping and you have no food packed with you, the first meal still counts as breakfast. I think. I'm surprised because you used to keep some food from each meal so that you had a little, a little food, uh, when you were on your own, backed away. Yeah, that, that would be, that would be smart planning. What's, uh, what's the weather like? Uh, you are in Croatia right now? Oh, we're in, we're in delightful fun right now and I'm so happy about that. Um, was it the same in the last few days or? Well, yes, yesterday was mixed sun and cloud before. That was pretty much all cloud and it, it changes the pace of everything but it still brings your mood and spirit high when there's sun and you're on a solar bicycle. And, uh, and every time you stop for a bit, your battery comes back more charged and yeah, it's a nice feeling. Cool. Cool. Well, especially since you have quite a, a heavy bike altogether. Um, I noticed this morning, I, I saw your story on the group wechat. We have about the free wheel that you got a repair last night. Can you tell us more about this? Yeah, we've had an unbelievable experience in Croatia. One of the mechanical things on our bike that kind of most nervous about from the beginning was the free wheel that links the rolling system to the pedaling system because it's always going backwards towards, backwards towards. And that's a pretty harsh thing to have deal with mechanically. Uh So when we built the, the unit before I left, I always planned to have a backup piece with me, but it was working good enough, it wasn't pro priority. And then as you know, on our initial trip to um to cha money, we had the that free wheel that was built in failed, but Guillaume had enough tools to be able to remove the broken part inside, continue using it. And I have my team in Vancouver. Uh they're gonna be preparing a replacement for us. Uh But obviously that didn't get built and shipped to us in time. And then yesterday, it finally happened where the free wheel we were using, stopped working and uh and then we search on Google. We're in just the tiniest little towns in Croatia right now. Uh pretty near the border with Serbia, lots and lots of abandoned houses, no big commercial centers. And so search bicycle repair, uh found a thing on, on Google that was about 30 kilometers away. And we had enough battery just promoted there with a human power and we get there and it's just a house and then we like this can't be right. What's going on? It says it's a bicycle repair store. And then on the side of the house, you see this tiny little sign that says BC, collect, stop something repair. It was easy enough to understand. Um So we knocked and had so little hope of anything. And then older man answered the door and, um, I had pre translated on my phone, you know, hey, we're touring from Canada. We have a bicycle problem, uh wondering if she can help us prepare it. Um And luckily enough, he, he has enough English that he was able to talk. Oh, no, not me. But my son and then he picked up a cellphone phones the National Day with uh in Croatia yesterday. And 10 minutes later, his son shows up and sure enough shows us to his backyard garage and it's just packed with various bicycle parts and tools. And he's been running a side business is the only person in town that services and fix pics. Um And through miracle of good fortune, he had just the pieces we need, including a single seat, free wheel and all the machinery tools to disassemble and unscrew the old one. And uh and so what he was doing all that he insisted on me not helping. Then his, his uh father told us all of his story. He's a, you know, multi generational Croatian um has been living in that little house all along. And uh um yeah, it was just such a marvelous experience. And then they, they refused any kind of offers of, of, of payment for that. They were just very happy to uh help some travelers. And yeah, so they stories of life in very well. It's amazing that you don't have to go very far to actually experience so much uh hospitality uh when you're on a long trip like that. No, and that's, that's been our experience all along. And I mentioned that part of why we've had such a difficulty. Our goal has been to make 200 kilometers a day and we've only succeeded in that about half of the days. Um And we keep not making it because because of hospitality, we're running into people and."
31,"Alright, cool. Uh I'm still black and I'm here with Grant and Johnny from Blank Range. What's up, dude? Hello, howdy. So uh I'll be opening for you guys in Richmond on July 26th at Capital Ill Health. And uh I'm looking forward to it. I think it's gonna be a really fun night. Can't wait ourselves. Yeah. Um so I usually like to start off with um something that I think everybody can relate to, which is uh dude on the road. Um I remember when I met you guys, it was uh I was with matt and we were down at South by, we hopped in y'all's band and actually went out to uh nickki Lane's party. Um I remember remember you guys had that awesome like yeti cooler in the van. Oh, yeah. Is that a, is that a staple? Uh Yeah, it's a stable for us. We actually have a strict no food policy in it after uh notorious dairy and deli meat incident several years back. What happened? Yeah, you just aren't changing the ice and something falls into that water and then it becomes food water and maybe the milk spills and you don't clean it quite fast enough. Cool. It was gnarly. What was it? Taylor had milk for his tea that he was making and it, it exploded in there and it was, yeah, it was pretty bad. I was like, we have to get cold milk. That's like on catastrophize. Like solid milk. Mm. Sounds good. Yeah. What do you like to eat on the road? I don't know. It's so, it's so hard, um, to try not to eat fast food but, uh, for that in particular kind of obsessed with the angles. Oh, ok. What are your other, what's your favorite fast food spot? Do you have like a, I mean, pro probably is Chick-fil-A included, you know, because that's kind of like the best, but Wendy's is always a good deal. Ok. Yeah, we sell a Taco-Bell a lot. Yeah. This is, uh, good options for like, vegetarians and stuff. Yeah. One of the few places that has that, that John and, and Matt from our band kind of have a history there. It's sort of, yeah, tradition. And we, we eat vegetarian Taco-Bell. I will say that. Ok. Yeah, cciu. And we get on those long tours in a few days, Taco-Bell in a row. We're like aiming for a place that has a salad bar. But, yeah, try to get those leafy greens pretty often. We try to be fairly healthy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, uh, I'm always envious of people that have obviously a tour bus mostly just for the kitchen there. For real. Smash and grow after shows. Are you pro with that yet? I mean, I don't know if our writer will be fulfilled at this show. But are you, are you pretty pro at the smash and grab after the headliner leaves? Like snag all the snacks from there? Green room that they left. Oh, yeah, I'll do that. If I'm not even playing the show, I'll just try to get in. We gotta survive out here, man. What did you say? Yeah, it's tough to survive out there. You gotta take what you can get. Definitely. So you guys are gonna be open in for Nicky lane. Yeah, most of this month, um, is all, I guess we filled in a few spots. We're really happy to be able to play with you in Richmond, man. It's gonna be a good time, but pretty much everything else we're doing on that run is opening for nickki. Awesome. Have you guys played with her before? Oh, yeah. One time in 2014, I think at South by. But, uh, yeah, known, known the band and seen her around for years and then last weekend. Yeah, we played a couple shows. It was a really good time with those guys. Well, I think I went to, doesn't she have a vintage shop? Yeah. High class hillbilly is what it's called."
32,"Hello. Hey, Dan. Hey, how are you? Good. How are you? Not too bad. Um, so if it's cool with you, I'm gonna record this. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. How's it going? Have you been happy with the release so far? Yeah. Yeah, I, I think, uh, I think, well, I mean, I'm, I'm somewhat detached from it, uh, from what I hear it's going well. Awesome. So, uh, one of the things that I really, like, just really caught my ear first was the production of it. There's a lot of things going on but it, it all sounds really good. Um, maybe, do you mind just telling me a little bit about how you recorded it? Uh, it was recorded on a track cassette, uh, machine originally once I, once, you know, all the, all the dead instruments and, and vocals, actually everything except, uh, the strings, horns and piano, which were done when, when we got back from, uh, Europe were recorded on the, the eight track. Awesome. Where did you record it, or where did you record track stuff? The A track stuff was done in, uh, Carl Sad Sweden. Uh, I had like a month um, just kind of layover between tours. And so, uh, my friend Roya, let us take it in our cabin for a month. And, uh, that is the song and the song after all the Yeah. Yeah. And she sourced all the, all the materials we were gonna need. Minus the tape machine. Cool. Is that your tape machine? Well, we bought it, uh, in, uh Copenhagen. It was kind of a strange situation where we're looking for a very specific machine that was most likely going to be very hard to find. And then in the end, uh the guy who was hosting our air BNB had, uh, had one for sale. Yeah. Yeah, that's like really fortuitous. Yeah, big time. Um What kind of tape machine is it? Um, it was a Yamaha. I'm gonna ask Kenny because I don't remember exactly. Ok. Do you remember the, what, what that uh eight track was Yamaha, right? Oh, it's like the, uh, what is it? Uh mmtmt eight. Yeah, that's right because I used to use the mini disk version of the same thing. Office was the MD eight. Yeah, I have a, um, Tascam 388 little, uh quarter inch eight track. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I love, I love recording on tape. Yeah. So, um, you don't, Matt told me that you don't fly? No, but you tour in Europe. So you take, you take a ship? Yeah, that's pretty cool. Yeah. Are you, are you gonna be taking a ship over this fall when you guys go over there? That's awesome. Is the, um, does the, does the whole band go on the ship or is it mostly just it? Yeah, me and whoever else, uh, wants to join this is how long does it take? Uh, seven days. So you do a lot of writing and stuff on the ship? Yeah, I do whatever I bring, I bring supplies to Kill the Boor. Yeah. Well, that's cool. Um, so I really like the song Modern Pressure. And I guess one question I had is, did you, did you write the song first or? Did you have the, um, album title first? Um, I wrote the song first. Uh, what is Modern Pressure, like, mean mean to you? Um, I, I don't really know anymore. You probably made sense at the time but I, I, I'm, uh, I'm somewhat distanced from it now. Um, I mean, I think it means something entirely different, uh, than the, than the whole, than the record in its entirety to me now. But, uh, at the time, uh, yeah, I can't exactly recall. Do you think that that was kind of like, like, spread from Freeverse? Uh, ok. Do you find that a lot of your songs kind of change meaning after they're kind of like, out in the world and they have a life? Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, in, in a sense they, they no longer represent me or belong to me. Well, I guess they represent me but, uh."
33,"Hi, everyone. This is Rebecca Soler. I'm the audiobook narrator for the series and I am so privileged and psyched to be speaking with Marissa meyer. Hi, everybody. I'm Marissa. I'm of course, the author of Lunar Chronicles and I'm very thrilled to be here as well. Ok. So, first things first, how do you feel to be, you know, completely finished with such an amazing series? Oh, it's been very bittersweet. On one hand, I'm very excited for the book to be out in the world. Um I've kind of known how the series is going to end since the very beginning when I first started coming up with the story and the characters. So I'm really looking forward to being able to share the ending with readers and I hope that they'll uh find it satisfactory and that they'll, you know, have loved going along on this ride with me. But on the other hand, you know, I've been living with these characters for the last seven years of my life and it's really sad to be kind of saying goodbye to them and sending them on their way. So it's a very bittersweet thing. Personally, I loved being able in this last book to really see Luna for the first time and see the people of Luna and, and see how the disparity and, you know, in terms of how people were living, the citizens versus the, the aristocracy. I'm really glad that you made that change and had Scarlett kidnapped. And, well, thank you. It was a lot of fun and it gave me, um, you know, having changing it so that winter and the crew now ends up in one of the outer sectors. And I always thought we would end up in the outer sectors eventually anyway, because that, you know, made the most sense for where the uprising would start. Um But having that more personal connection and developing that uh friendship between Winter and Scarlett and both of them kind of getting to see the outer sectors and, and, you know, Wolf's family and, and all of these other little things together. Um I felt had much bigger impact your attention to detail and just the way that you would weave in just little, little plot lines was just something as a reader. And as the narrator, I loved to discover, like for example, learning that wolf never had a tomato, not because of, you know, him being a wolf, but rather because in the outer sectors, they, they weren't um given access to fresh produce was so devastating. And also such like a little nugget of uh exploration that like you got to find as a reader. It was a really cool detail. Well, thank you. And I feel as a writer so often those little details, um kind of surprised me. Like, it's, it's one of those weird things of being a writer that you don't always feel like you're totally in control. You don't always feel like it's, you writing the story. Um You know, sometimes I'll be writing along and a little detail will just, you know, come out of my fingers and onto the page and I think, oh, wow. So that explains so much. I had no idea. Um And so I always feel like I'm discovering the world and the characters uh for the first time as long as well as the reader, were there other fairytales that you explored, potentially weaving in or were there any that you wished you had the opportunity to sort of explore or any that you would revisit in a different capacity? Oh, sure. Tons. Um When I was first planning, I had a whole list of fairytales that I wanted to include. Um And the one that almost made it into the series was Puss and Boots. Um Yeah, which is one of my favorite fairytales. And uh so originally I had planned for this to be a five book series and Puss and Boots was going to be the final in the series. But then as I was outlining and, and figuring out how all these stories fit together. It became pretty clear, pretty quickly that it just didn't fit and wasn't working. Um, so it didn't puss and boots didn't last very long in the planning process. Um, but there was a time when I thought I was going to do a, a puss and boots book as well. Uh, but now, I mean, I still love fairytales. I would love to someday do a Rumpelstiltskin retelling. Um, I would love to do a bluebeard retelling at some point. Uh But I don't know that they will be um sci-fi or Lunar Chronicles related or possibly something completely different or if I'll even ever do them at all. But those are definitely two fairytales that I see lots of potential for. Oh, those are really, really interesting. I will say that we have a, a short story collection coming out called Stars Above in February. Um And there is an epilogue type story in that collection that will take place about two years after the end of winter. Um And I, I'm, I don't know, I'm trying to think what am I allowed to say about it. Um I can tell you that there is a wedding."
34,"All right, you are rocking with the rock live on the air. I have the famous voice of foreigner, Mr Lou. Graham Lou. How are you doing tonight? Thank you for joining me tonight. I'm really honored that you're able to call in. I know you have a very busy schedule, but thank you once again. My pleasure. Now, I know you have a tour coming up. It's a brand new tour. 14 city tour. And you start tonight in Shelton, Washington. How excited are you to be out on the road again? And what motivated you starting this tour? Ah, we, we've been touring pretty, pretty steadily, ah, during spring and summer for the last seven or eight years. And, and this is our usual start up time and we usually go til, ah, til, til the end of October. And, ah, we, we usually cover about 40 or 50 cities. So, so, ah, ah, ah, maybe what you see on our, on our schedule right now is just the beginning of it. And, uh, uh, we, we two are pretty steadily. We, we do, we do mostly weekends now and, uh, we, we enjoy ourselves quite a bit. That's great. Now, can you tell us a little bit about the band that's gonna be touring with you? Yeah. Um My brother Bet on drums. Andy. No, on, on keyboards and Ad Zimmer on bass and Michael Stato on, on guitar. Those are all Rochester, New York musicians except for my brother who lives in Manhattan. And, uh, you know, it's, it's good to play with the hometown boys. And, uh we, we, we have a lot of great players in Rochester. Will your twins be joining you for this tour? I know they joined you in the past doing some encores, a couple of other tours back in the day. 00, yeah. This, this summer they'll be out with us for a couple of weeks. They're, uh, you know, they're, they're gonna be 15 this year. So I think, uh, this might be the last, last time they want to tour with us, uh, because their, their, their summers are filled up with sports and other stuff, you know, right now, what is your set list going to be like? Is it gonna be a mix of foreigner and your solo works? It definitely will. Yeah, maybe with an old Beatles song thrown in there. That's great. I'm actually honored to see you next Friday at the Le Way Theater here in Millville. I'm definitely gonna check you out and I'm really honored to have tickets to be able to go and see this legendary voice of the eighties. Uh Thanks. Uh We, we won't just promise you that we, we're gonna, we're gonna rock the house. That's great. I'm a fellow musician. So I have a question for you. How did you go about presenting new songs to the band when you were a foreigner? Because your writing abilities are amazing and you came out with so many great hits. Did you just present lyrics to them or was it all a collaborative effort? It was a lot of, it was collaborative effort. Uh And, and uh a lot of times Mick Mick would present me with musical ideas and, and, and asked me to put, put a, put a lyric and a melody to it and, and then there'd be sometimes when, ah, for instance, jukebox hero I presented to him, ah, the, the whole intro in the verse and, and we collaborated on, on the, on the chorus. So, you know, it can work, it can work a million different ways as long as you have that collaborative spirit and the willingness to give and take, you know. Yes, absolutely. The chemistry was definitely there for sure. Now, speaking of one of your hits, I want to know what love is. Definitely was one of the greatest rock ballads. Basically, people say it is. Did you know you had a classic in your hands when you wrote it and completed the song? Ah, we, we, we were extra excited about it. Ah, and, and ah, I don't know. There, there, there was this, there was this buzz, especially after, after, um, you know, the chorus was on, the choir was on it and, and, and, and, ah, it, it was mixed and, and it just listen to the mix and it, it just, it put chill in us, you know, and, and the, the record company president, ah, came down and listen and, and, uh, you know, we were getting on the back as if we had a hit already. You know, when, when the reality is nobody knows if it's gonna be a hit or not. So, so while we took their, their, their best wishes to heart, we, we still, we still knew that, that it was anybody's guess whether it would catch on or not. And, and fortunately, we, we scored a number one hit around the world, you know. Absolutely. And speaking of hits in 1976 you made your first album coming from Black Sheep to Foreigner and how did it feel to have the first hit? It feels like the first time going from a local band now to, you know, worldwide known band almost at that time with that big hit. How did it feel for you? Well, it was fantastic. Mind you, uh, uh, a although, although a Black Sheep was, was a Rochester band, we, we, uh, we had two albums uh on Capitol Records and we were touring with the likes of, uh, ah, 10 years after and Kiss, you know, in, in those years that was, that was Big guns and, and we did see the world and, and played a lot of shows with, with, with a lot of important headliners. So, so I, I kind of, I kind of felt seasoned already."
35,"How are you doing, Warren? I'm doing just fine. How are you doing? I'm doing fantastic. It is a pleasure to have you on the line tonight. My pleasure. Um, we've solicited questions from our listeners and through myspace and through email and, um, first I'll ask the question, all the Allman-Brothers fans want an answer to. How's Greg doing? Greg's doing great? Uh, he's, he's doing really great and, uh, we're going to go back to work in August and, you know, theoretically be in tiptop shape. Fantastic. I think everybody's happy to hear that. And the question everybody else wants to know too. How's Warren Ays doing? I'm doing wonderful. No complaints. The road isn't beaten you up too bad. I've actually had more time off this year starting, I guess, starting after Thanksgiving, but mostly January, February March than I've had probably in 10 years. So it's, uh, it's been quite nice. A little bit of rest can do us all some good. Yeah, absolutely. So, listen, I've been going to the New Year's Eve shows for the last couple of years and, uh, the Winter of Love mule, a go go dub side of the mule how do you come up with the themes for the government mule, New Year's Eve shows? Well, uh you know, there's a group of us that just throw out ideas and see we can come up with something that makes sense that we think we could pull off, that would be unexpected and, uh you know, fit into kind of the overall picture of, of what government mule is all about. Um It, it takes a lot of work and we start preparing way in advance, you know, but it, it, it's worth it. Those shows end up being some of the highlights of the year. Are you guys already thinking about what you might do on New Year's Eve this, this year coming up? Yeah, I mean, it's a little premature but we've started thinking about it, but we haven't, we haven't really come up with anything concrete yet. Um I'm just curious, you know, this past New Year's Eve you had a, a DJ on stage from uh radio station WC OS. Um Was that Joey Arnst that uh it was a guy named Stephen Payne who uh is an actor and we hired him to uh to be the DJ for the evening. He wasn't really a DJ and there really is. No W CS. Yeah, everybody's still looking for Joey Arkins. Joey is a hard man to pin down. Yes, he is. Um Let's see, what else do we have here? Many people are obviously familiar with your work with the Allman-Brothers Band and Government Mule. But, uh, could you tell us briefly about, um, your involvement with Evil Teen Records hardhead management and, and the charitable organizations that you're involved with? Well, let's start with Evil Teen. Evil Teen is a label that was originally, uh, founded by my wife Stephanie Scamardo. And then a few years ago it had kind of gone a little dormant, there was not a lot going on and we decided to kind of uh relaunch it and I got more involved with it at that point as a, an opportunity to put out music that we have in the can that doesn't necessarily qualify as a major label release. Uh starting with a lot of the charity stuff like uh the Christmas Jam show that I do in Asheville, North Carolina every year. This coming one is going to be the 20th anniversary. We put out two C DS, uh which would be volume and volume one and volume two of the benefit concert. We're about to put out, we're about to skip ahead to volume eight, which will be the first DVD, which is from two years ago with Dave Matthews and Taj Mahal and Branford Marsalis and Government Mule and marty Stuart and the uh New Orleans Social Club and uh uh John Copper Project with, with DJ Logic. It's a, it was a wonderful show and we put the highlights out um the, the proceeds for all that stuff go to Habitat for humanity. The ticket sales, the merchandise sales, the DVD sales, uh, everything goes to habitat Hardhead management is my wife, Stephanie's company that she founded many, many years ago when we first met, she was in the music business and I was in the music business, but at the time, we kind of agreed to not work together, uh, which we kind of, uh, honored that agreement up until when government mule was founded in late 94. Uh and I had my own manager and, uh Allen woody and Matt PPS. I inherited my manager, so to speak. And, uh they were unhappy with, with the manager, with the management situation and kind of uh came to me and said, we would really like it if, uh if your wife became our manager, what would you think about that? And of course."
36,"I have on the phone line, uh Coach Byron Smith just pulled off the, uh, upset over the Fresno State school dogs out on the road and coach, uh, congratulations on an exciting win and, uh, give us a summary and recap of tonight's contest. Well, Mike, thank you. I appreciate it. Uh The support. Hey, you know, what can I say? I think it was just a total team effort, you know, the entire 40 minutes, um, that I have to say, you know, our, our approach, uh, you know, to the game, um, you know, we were, we were very, very, very focused and had an unbelievable shoot around today, uh, and everyone was locked in and, uh, you know, just, just, just really, really focused and locked in on the things that we needed to do and that we do, you know, any time you're on the road, it's tough, you know, I mean, very, very difficult. Um, our guys came out and, um, and just really got after it, um, you know, defensively, um, you know, f very athletic, very similar to us, you know, program a lot of like size players. Um, you know, they play multiple positions, so they had to get up and down and they've got a lot of playmakers. But, yeah, our guys just came out tonight and just locked in and, um, you know, I just really kind of took it to him and I just played a really smart basketball game and, you know, as you, uh you know, mentioned earlier, we, we, we were, uh, and you said 83% you know, from the line, I think 26 to 31 which was, which is really a nice something that we talked about as a team and we wanna try to shoot right at about 75 you know, 80 is a bit of a stretch. But if we can be at 75% of the team, I think that can really help us, uh, you know, make sure in basketball games, but just a total team. That's what did everything that we needed to do, you know, to, uh, to, to get the victory and it ended up having six guys in double figures, uh, with shes, uh, that helps a lot and, uh, so we balance going. Uh, they do a better job on the rebounding. I think we still go minus 14 on the glass. Let me do a better job rebounding the ball and, and I think we'll do that, but we can only get better. This is only one game, but definitely something big for our guys and really great. For their morale. Very good. And you say it's only one game but what a difference a game like this can make for going down the road in the stretch as you lean toward conference. But you got another tall order coming up against Saint Mary, but we'll just push that in just a moment. You got six guys in double figures. You're 26 or 31 from the line at the half, you're trailing by 5 41 36. What do you tell the guys at the half? Because you, you, you put it all together, you have the perfect storm to come together in the second half. What do you tell these guys at the half? So I, like I told them that the other night in this or state we were down 14.5. So you see this, that you've made already, I mean, and, you know, obviously Fresno iii, I thought, you know, Fresno probably would give us more trouble if not as much, if not more trouble with Oregon State because they're so athletic. But you know that right there just showed them and I try to, you know, you know, really press the issue, the fact that we've shown that much improvement in, um in 48 hours just with watching film, you know, having open discussions and, and, and, and getting feedback from the guys and really just take it to the practice floor that was already shown, you know, great improvement. They were down five points to a very form the team, you know, the defending Mountain West, uh, champions, uh, you know, from last year. But, you know what, we were right there probably shouldn't have been down five, you know, made a couple of mistakes at the end, gave them some, gave them some easy baskets and things like that. But, you know, III, I thought, you know, that once they realized that, hey, you know what? You can, uh, you know, I only play with these guys but, you know, we do the things we need to do. We really lock in, you know, we, we can come out victorious. So, uh, you know what, they came out, we didn't hold them in the lock room too long. It came out, they got warmed up really good. You know, we started the second half, you know, having the basketball and, uh, you know, we, we got it, we got it tied up pretty quick and taking the lead and, you know, it was just, it was just our night tonight but, you know, we, we, we, we counted everything that they wanted to do. Um, they really had a hard time defending us in the pick and roll. I mean that there's something, you know, it's very simple but yet it's very, very hard to go, you know, the pick and roll and we do a really good job and our players sco uh uh the Blakely, Jonte Blakely, really, you know, kind of spearheaded us, uh you know, offensively, um and just kept the ball to the right people. And uh you know, and obviously when they started fo wanted to make sure not that so to team that very, very proud of our guys that happy for them. They worked so hard over two months to prepare for the season and we just want something good to happen to these kids. They worked so hard and, uh, and trying to do everything they can to represent player view in the highest fashion. Well, it's an absolute great joy to watch these guys, uh transition up and down the court and, and how they're putting it all together, camaraderie is building and, and a win like this, as we mentioned earlier can go such a long way and you're really just beginning. You got number 17 ranks Saint Mary, uh on, on the, hey, well, you know how to pick them, huh? Coach, well, it can only make you better, right? You want to be the best, you got to play against the best. So it the best."
37,"For most of history, the overwhelming majority of the earth's inhabitants have owned more or less nothing. The clothes, they stood up in some bowls, a pot and a pan, perhaps a broom. And if things were going really well, a few farming implements, nations and peoples remained consistently poor. Global GDP did not grow at all. From year to year. The world was in aggregate as hard up in 1800 as it had been at the beginning of time. However, starting in the early 18th century, in the countries of northwestern Europe, a remarkable phenomenon occurred, economies began to expand and wages to rise. Families who'd never before had any money beyond what they needed just to survive. Found they could go shopping for small luxuries, a comb or a mirror, a spare set of underwear, a pillow, some thicker boots or a towel. Their expenditure created a virtuous economic cycle. The more they spent, the more businesses grew, the more wages rose by the middle of the 18th century. Observers recognized that they were living through a period of epochal change that historians have since described as the world's first Consumer Revolution. It was in Britain where the changes were most marked. Enormous new industries sprang up to cater for the widespread demand for goods that had once been the preserve of the very rich alone in England cities, you could buy furniture from Chippendale, Hepplewhite and Sheraton pottery from Wedgwood and Derby cutlery from the Smitheries-of-Sheffield and hats, shoes and dresses featured in the best-selling magazines like The Gallery of Fashion and the Ladies Magazine Styles for Clothes, Hair, which had formerly gone unchanged for decades now altered every year often in extremely theatrical and impractical directions. In the early 17 seventies, there was a craze for decorated wigs so tall, their tops could only be accessed by standing on a chair. It was fun for the cartoonists so vivid and numerous were the consumer novelties that the austere doctor Johnson wryly wondered whether prisoners were also soon to be hanged in a new way. The Christian church looked on and did not approve up and down England clergymen delivered bitter sermons against the new materialism. They called it vanity, which was a sin. Sons and daughters were to be kept away from shops. God would not look kindly on those who paid more attention to household decoration than the state of their souls. But there now emerged an intellectual revolution that sharply altered the understanding of the role of vanity in an economy. In 1723 a London physician called Bernard Mandeville published an economic tract titled The Fable of the Bees which proposed that contrary to centuries of religious and moral thinking, what made countries rich and therefore safe, honest, generous spirited and strong was a very minor unelevated and apparently undignified activity, shopping for pleasure. It was the consumption of what Mandeville called fripperies, hats, bonnets, gloves, butter, dishes, soup, terrines, shoe horns and hair clips that provided the engine for national prosperity and allowed the government to do in practice what the church only knew how to sermonize about. In theory, make a genuine difference to the lives of the weak and the poor. The only way to generate wealth argued Mandeville was to ensure high demand for absurd and unnecessary things. Of course, no one needed embroidered handbags, silk line slippers or ice creams. But it was a blessing that they could be prompted by fashion to want them for on the back of demand for such trifles, workshops could be built, apprentices, trained and hospitals funded. Mandeville shocked his audience with the starkness of the choice he placed before them. A nation could either be very high minded, spiritually elevated, intellectually, refined and dirt poor, or a slave to luxury and idle consumption and very rich. Mandeville's dark thesis went on to convince almost all the great anglophone economists and political thinkers of the 18th century. There were nevertheless some occasional departures from the new economic orthodoxy. One of the most spirited and impassioned voices was that of Switzerland's greatest philosopher Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, shocked by the impact of the consumer revolution on the manners and atmosphere of his native Geneva. He called for a return to a simpler, older way of life of the sort he had experienced in alpine villages or read about in traveller's accounts of the native tribes of North America in the remote corners of Upsell or the vast forests of Missouri. There was blessedly no concern for fashion and no one-upmanship around hair extensions. Russo recommended closing Geneva's borders and imposing crippling taxes on luxury goods so that people's energies could be redirected towards non material values. He looked back with fondness to the austere martial spirit of Sparta."
38,"OK, I am excited. Let me share with you a couple of things and then we're gonna have a, a speaker today who's gonna give you something that's really empowering how many of you would like to have a better use and management of your time. I see, I see a bunch of short arms here. Ok. Can you put your arms up if you really would like them? Ok. Uh You know, I, I have a friend who uh he told me, he said, mel do you use Outlook? I said not really, but I actually really do. I didn't really, I don't use all the functionality for Outlook. I have a shared calendar with my staff so they know where I'm at, right? And we can put appointments on there and I put appointments and they get to know, you know what my schedule is. But as far as using it as a contact management system, using it as a way to remind me of things. Using it as a way to just send myself alerts, use it as a way to keep uh notes on conversations that I have with the clients and the prospects I don't do that. I haven't done that. Uh And I used to do it years ago I had a program that's called Talk For You. So it is rather expensive, but a really awesome program. And what I've heard about this thing, outlook is that the cost is really important. That's what I heard. It's like free, right, free, free is a great price with the purchase of a computer. That's great advice. And I bet you can put it on your smartphone too. I bet. How do you think put in your smartphone? So it's a powerful, powerful tool. Uh And I I'm gonna have uh my friend Craig er who, who is a master at Outlook. He get some updates on how you can use Outlook as a uh management program of your time before I do that. Let me share a couple of things that's happening with us. The company, we've ordered more furniture. Hopefully we paid for it. We're just waiting for it to be delivered, man. It's just amazing. You know, we, we, we have enough chairs to support this workstation. We have a com you like those? They are very nice, very comfortable. Oh, glad, glad, glad, come and use them. Ok, great. All right. So we, we got chairs of order for another workstation like this is a little bit shorter in the area where the copy room is at. Right. And then we're ordering some partitions around the workstation where Nancy and Floyd and Jeanette's area is ok. So that's what we're doing. We ordered a reception area that's really nice and sleek, slick looking. But, you know, we paid them may 26 and they're supposed to be delivered three weeks later. But, uh, it's not here yet. They tell us they'll be here Friday. So, we'll see. Right. We'll see if it's gonna come. Uh, what we're planning to do is start to decorate our office. You know, all these paintings have been on the wall. We'll use some of them, some of them we won't. Um And um what we're gonna do is just make our place really, really beautiful, a great attractive area to be. And I want to share with you. There are a lot of agents in our neighboring markets here who don't know about us and I want you to tell him and I'm gonna offer you a bounty. I'm gonna offer you a bounty, you know what a bounty is. Reward. Yeah. So let's say every agent that you bring our way that signs up with us on their first two transactions. I will give you $500 each a these two or when they, when they close. And I don't care if it's a buyer or a seller. When they close the transaction, you get $500 from our company for each one. So I was just coming up and this guy was walking and then he walked in and he goes is there a realtor? Here I go. Yeah. Upstairs. He goes, Sahara. I don't know Mel-Wilson. I said, may I help you? He goes, I work at next door but it's my break right now when I used to be a realtor and I want to come and I said, come upstairs and somebody might be able to, you know, talk to you. Then I realize you guys are meeting. But by the time I turn back he goes, no, I don't have time right now because it's like 1010 minutes in your car. I came in to get a card to give it and then he's gone because he had only, I guess he was on his break. He was smoking and had a coffee in his hand. All right. Well, opportunity here. Opportunity presents itself when you are prepared. You know, when does it start? Start or what it started today? You got somebody right now. Oh, no, I just go to school. No, no. That, what are you? I just, I didn't give you, oh, let me start it over. I just got, I, I, I'll start over. Every, we are on a growth mode. Every agent that you bring to our company that signs up with us on their first closing."
39,"We always like to start out with good news and we have more good news for everybody. And this is again, just representation of all of your hard work. So we uh had over uh this is just April statistics and so over 37 million in volume for April alone. So we're up quite a bit over this time last year. So April last year as well as transactions are up um and commissions are up again. So congratulations to all of you on great work. There. Is there a reason that the body can get 23 that comes from Roy up 13. So uh the only thing that we're coming up with is that some people are getting, taking less commissions on some things, but we're diving into that right now. So these are the numbers that Kyle gave me and it's a big spread. I agree with him. So I do. Yeah, that's it if that's the case. Yeah. So way to go, john, thanks for bringing our numbers down. Uh The other great piece of news is from real trends and so there's a sheet that Kayla handed out and so Remax of Grand Rapids again ranked uh within the top 50 brokerages nationwide. And so this is even outside of just Remax brokerages. And we're number 13, uh this is just a huge accomplishment and this is based on ranking brokerages on transactions per agent. So with that large number there really, it's just a testament to how experienced our agents are, how much business they're doing and a great piece of marketing material for you as well. When you start talking with folks about, they come work with the best. You know, we have the best of the best over at Remax of Grand Rapids. And the proof is right here when you rank us against all the brokerages in the nation. So really something to be incredibly proud of. Um we're up from last year, I think last year around the 20th or so. And so we climbed and so we're really proud of everybody here for, for all that effort and we wanna break that top 10 next year. So we're on a, a strong pace to do that. It's like we'll never be, never won there though. Yeah, that one is uh uh 89. That's kind of a an anomaly that I really think they should be thrown out as an outlier. Um But they are uh pat mentioned what the, what that company is, I can just do the transaction side. They're not actually like selling agents, but they're still, I know she explained it on the Facebook post, I saw that, but that's just absurd, but really just a great piece of uh marketing material for you. We're gonna do some uh boosted Facebook ads around this as well to help promote the company. Um, and really as well for agents who are interested in coming to, to work with us, the the best of the best really reside here. So if they wanna surround themselves with that, this is a great piece of marketing material for that as well. So, congratulations to all of you on that. So impressive, very impressive, impressive. That's huge, isn't it? I mean, right there, it's just proof that that brand is so much power and we really do have the best of the best like Dave Hunter always says, yeah. So speaking of, of that and the best of the best, uh we had the opportunity to uh participate in an event where many of those, the best of the best brokers were in attendance at broker catalyst and uh premier broker summit. And for the first time, they, they combined the two where we got a lot more interaction with those uh the premier brokers that come in. So really, those are the, the really large guys doing 200 plus um agents and a significant amount of volume. So we had a great three days in Arizona and we have some things to share with you over the next few weeks and months. We think some really good information and we wanted to start sharing some of that today. One of the speakers was Darren Hardy and he put together this entire program around productivity and he put it through an entire day workshop. We didn't quite get through the whole book, but we got through quite a bit of it and there's some good worksheets in here that we'll be sharing as well."
4,"Someone who will be committed to rolling back healthcare for millions of Americans and someone who it looks pretty likely will help Donald Trump if he gets into serious criminal trouble. Senator, does it give you any comfort that in Judge Kavanaugh's writing in 2009, when he was saying that indicting and prosecuting a president would be bad for the country that he kept saying repeatedly throughout the article that only you in Congress can prevent that, that only Congress can pass a bill to basically defer any prosecutions of the president until after the president leaves office. You know, the part that worries me most is he keeps talking about what a disaster it would be for the country. And ultimately, the Supreme Court is going to have to make law in areas where we don't have precedent and in other opinions, Judge Kavanaugh has already made clear he's willing to put his own judgment in and to put his judgment on the line. And if he thinks that it would be a disaster for Donald Trump to be indicted, he looks like somebody who could very much be on Trump's side and what's so worrisome about all of this. Is he very well could be the deciding vote in whether or not a criminal prosecution against the president goes forward. Look, I get it. We're looking ahead but this is a president right now who hears the hoof beats of an investigation that is bearing down on him. The Mueller investigation has been going forward. It is already produced multiple indictments, multiple guilty pleas and all of the threads keep tying back to Donald Trump himself. And that's a real problem. And Donald Trump is nothing. If not a man who protects first and foremost Donald Trump, would you suggest uh to uh Democrats or opponents of the nomination that the, the place to go to work is in Maine and Alaska to try to uh get the votes of your Republican colleagues there. The only two Republican senators who are prochoice look the way I see this is nobody makes it to the Supreme Court without a majority in the United States Senate. And I think people all across this country need to raise their voices. Always keep in mind on this. We didn't have the votes to protect the Affordable Care Act. We didn't have them. Uh I remember the day after Donald Trump was sworn in thinking about the fact that now the Republicans control the house, control the Senate control the White House. They could roll back Obamacare next week and I really feared they would do it. But people across this country raised their voices and it got bigger and it got louder and bigger and louder and it was Democrats, it was Republicans, it was independents. People made their voices heard. And ultimately, when they did that, we got enough Republicans to cross the aisle and to save healthcare for tens of millions of Americans. You know, that is the remarkable part about a democracy. We raise our voices. We can all still be he heard in Washington. And for me, that's what this is about right now, raising our voices. All of us, we need to speak up like we've never spoken up before. This is the time, I'm sure there will be questions in the judiciary committee, especially from Democrats about the rights of Children who are being held, uh, at the southern border, some of whom you were able to visit when, when you went down there. Uh Judge Kavanaugh has already ruled in, in that arena last fall. Uh NBC news reports that Judge Kavanaugh wrote a decision siding with the Trump administration, lawyers to block a migrant teenager in Texas from being released from custody to receive an abortion. Uh, he tried to prevent that. He was overruled by his own colleagues, uh, on the A Circuit court of Appeals and then he complained that his colleagues were creating a right to what he called abortion on demand for girls in that situation. Yeah. You know, I was just down there. Uh, uh two weeks ago yesterday down on the border and what I saw was deeply shocking. I talked, I met directly with women whose Children had been taken away from them, women who had been lied to when their Children were taken away. Women who had absolutely no idea where their Children were and women who with one exception had, had no phone calls, no contact whatsoever."

41,"Fair princess. Imagine if I were the internet and you were a toothbrush, a toothbrush is that the best you've got or a refrigerator, a mini drone, whatever. But your social media, it says passionate about the internet of things. You'd liberate me from only being on computers and I'd free you from just being a toothbrush. Let me guess together, we'd reach our full potential as part of the internet of things we'd create and share data and by analyzing all of that information, we learn how to do things better improve lives and build new experiences, dental hygiene experiences. Well, internet of things is about connecting any physical object to the internet. There will be between 30 50 billion IoT devices within the next few years. The only limit is your imagination. Ok. Well, if I had to imagine I'd rather be a self sustaining urban farm, a smart vehicle or why not a connected oyster? I totally could have come up with those too. It's not that hard. Asta Roseway is already collaborating with urban farmers and machine learning researchers to design connected aquaponic farm modules that utilize real time crop analytics. This will be essential when nearly three quarters of the people around the world live in cities, or someday, it could even be a self sustaining food for long distance space travel. And Ross Harvey at AG Tech company The-Yield is using connected sensors to measure salinity, temperature and water depth. In dozens of Australian oyster-estuaries, cloud computing and Artificial intelligence are bringing greater visibility and accuracy to the fragile feet of bivalve production. Or there's Peggy-Johnson forging partnerships with automotive giants like Nissan Toyota and BMW to transform vehicles into intelligent platforms powered by the Microsoft cloud. So one day your car might also be your mobile office helping schedule meetings, find a location and even drive you there all with a world class digital security you need in the device that travels at 60 MPH. That's like a lot to um getting back to that toothbrush. Well, let's not make the mistake of thinking of IoT in terms of single devices. It's really an ecosystem of devices across homes, businesses and industries. One must have the skill experience and the steady hand to manage the whole ecosystem like Microsoft IoT T inside our lab that supports startups and major enterprises to invent the next generation of IoT T through hardware design, manufacturing app development and connecting devices to the cloud at scale. So what is it exactly that you bring to the table young man? Well, I'm uh did I mention that I'm a prince? Yeah, I could have guessed that. So, how about me rescuing you from the se tower? Oh, that's nice and all. Uh, but I actually own this place."
42,"For those who may not know me. I'm Randy Lund. I'm a senior controller at CBRE. I have been here about 4.5 years. Uh And I'm Shana bainbridge. I am a controller. I oversee our Minneapolis team of fund accounting professionals on the third floor. Some of you I know, but a lot of you are probably meeting for the first time. So as Linda alluded, we're here to talk about best practices and I think we do have a culture here of best practice, process improvement. I recently headed up A B to B or a backpack to briefcase event that we had and I was trying to get some statistics prior to that event of what our process improvement and best practices teams do. And through January through October, we had had 63 ideas brought to that committee generally from our accountants or shared services individuals that they have an idea and they wanted to bring that idea to the attention of management and leadership to vet that idea and to identify if there was something there that the ben that the department could benefit from. So I want to ensure that you guys understand that we have that culture here in within real estate accounting. But I also think that we can do even more. And that's why we identified this as a breakout session is to get that fire burning inside of you to if you have that idea, and it might not always be the final result, but it's that first idea that starts the conversation that leads to more conversation, that eventually leads to that wonderful idea that can lead to something great. And the one example I reflect on that I thought was so impactful and I know you guys recognize it as well that we had a process. It's been over a year ago now that we used to key in our journal entries into MRI and Yar E and it took a long time to do that. And one individual said, well, wait a second, I think we could probably upload those into the system and make that efficient and fast forward. It went through best practices and now it's an upload process. And I've asked quite a few people around and they said, how much does that save time? And the consistent estimate that I keep receiving is that per property per month, it saves an hour. And just think of that time that we've created to build into taking on additional properties, you know, freeing ourselves up to do more analytical work versus just keying a journal entry into the system. That's huge. So I think that's like a process and improvement for tactical things that we want to hear more of and that can lead to great things. And I know Shana has another example as well. Yeah, so my example is less tactical, but it's really how can I improve myself as a manager? A few years ago, the team was very small. I have seven people on the team. I could talk to everyone every day. I knew what was going on with their work life, their personal life, fast forward a couple of years. And now the team is over 20 almost 25 people. And there's just no way I can know everything that's going on. And I really struggled with that. One thing that came to mind was I had a team member who had a day off because he was going to sit for a section of the CPA exam. And I knew that I knew he was taking exam, but come the day before his day off, I said, hey, have a good day off, enjoy your time forgetting that it was actually not just a day off. He was sitting for the CPA exam. I felt terrible when someone told me about that after the fact. So I set myself a calendar reminder for the day he was coming back so that I could personally ask him how it went instead of just being an aloof manager who didn't know what was going on. And this is a personal and work related item. After that, I talked to a few other managers here that I know which is pretty good managers and asked how, how do you connect with your people on a day to day basis with in a genuine, you know, real way without it being a forced conversation. So, you know, I got a mixed bag of different ways and what I kind of decided was I should just try to make personal connections with a couple of people as I see them in the lunch room or in the coffee break room. Um And then if there's a follow up item, following up seeking them out a couple of days later asking how things went or, you know, asking about whatever we had talked about. That's something I'm still working on because I still struggle. I really would like to be on a personal level with everybody, but I know that that's not possible. Um Part of this session could be, you know, what you guys think or what do you guys do to maintain a level of connection with members of your team? Either if they report directly to you or maybe they just report to another manager."
43,"Good morning. I'd like to call the Order to the Education Committee for Wednesday, December 14th. And uh we're going to establish form Mark jamie Zamora here K and shan Michael Corradino. Absent Jeannie King. 30 A quorum, Jamie. Great. Um We'll move to item number two, the approval of the September 25th, 2015 Education Committee minutes. Do we have any concerns or changes from the board members for these minutes? Ok. Ok. Ok. So I recommend you because you were not present at that meeting, um that you abstain from your vote and that um the motion be to accept the minutes rather than improve them. Ok. Do I motion to accept, do I need a second hitman? Do we have any other changes? No. Ok. Then I will motion to accept the minutes. Do I have a second? My second, Mark jamie Zamora. Yes, Kevin Chan. Here, minutes are accepted to a Oh, Jeanie King. Yes, abs. Ok. Thank you. All right, great. Thanks, Mark. Uh We'll now move forward to item number three discussion and possible action of acupuncture-board ethics, continuing education requirement for licenses and possible recommendation to the board and I will let Mark take us through that. Ok, I'm actually gonna, I'll just sort of quickly review the history of this. But, um, I'm gonna have Jay-Hurt who's our education coordinator, uh, take it just as it's, um, sort of, it falls under his, uh, purview. Um, basically this is a, this is a, an issue that we've, um, had for a little while, um, in our, in our world, as they say, um, the language uh was originally proved back at the November 11th, 2012 board meeting in discussion with legal counsel. And, uh, and talking among staff, the feeling is that the, the existing text that was approved back in 2012 is, is a little vague and, um, maybe requires uh a little more definition. Um And we have set out some questions for the board members or some things to, to possibly discuss. Um uh And so the idea would be to, to perhaps um discuss the issue. Um uh if you'd like provide direction to staff, we can um come up with some additional, more refined language and bring it back to the committee or to the board, whatever the, the committee desires to do. So that's kind of the goal here. And Jay heard I'm the coordinator with uh I sport and as background um as background. Um I looked at a number of other boards in terms of what they have done with ethics and particularly, um, we looked at the Chiropractic board, the board of Psychology and the board of Physical Therapy. And they're very similar is that the patients are gonna be seeing um practitioners in a um sole proprietor um situation. So there's a good comparison there. Um And so I just give you a quick summary of what those boards do and then I'll let it go back to the board and they can discuss or further define uh what professional ethics are for the acupuncture-board. So, uh the chiropractor board, um chiropractor board requires two hours of uh um uh ethics and law continue education for each licensing cycle. And in addition, the chiropractic board has a uh law and ethics uh supplemental exam that applicants are required to take for um licensure. Um, the physical therapy board um in a similar vein has two hours of uh uh community education in law and ethics required. And they also have a, um California law exam that's required for life and it, and it's not just looking at their regulations. These law exams are the complete overview of California law. Um The psychology board, um the psychology board does not require any uh ce units in ethics, but they do uh require um each licensing cycle that the licensee um attests to the fact that they've kept up with ethics and law as based on their, regulate their regulatory structure. And then also the um psychology exam also has a, um uh a law and ethics exam the California Law and Ethics exam is required of licensure. So that's a little bit of background on that. And actually, if you, if we look at their accent, they do define a little bit, um, you know, in terms of the areas of what they're talking about in terms of, you know, particular issues."
44,"Thank you gentlemen for being here. Um, and so with these uh uh the subject kids, we don't get much assigned to us. But, um, since I've become the public, uh, uh employees chair, I have received all kind of feedback from different employees about things that are going on in the city. And I realized that I don't know enough about what's going on and how people properly complain. I know that, um, Altman Williamson, I think he sponsored a whistle blowers, uh, um, bill a few years ago. Um, but I don't know that our employees know how to address these issues. You know, even though we have things we don't do, we cannot sell them yet, but just a minute, uh, we, you cannot, uh, they don't know how to address the things still and they don't know who to talk to. So I get all these uh, anonymous letters. I mean, I got a stack of them, um, just from them knowing my name over the years. So I thought that we should have something that's, um, everybody knows about on this committee and then something that we could put out to the employees better about how, if they're being harassed sexually, uh, if they're being intimidated racially, if they're being, uh, passed over for, uh, employment, uh, black, white, green, orange, whatever, uh, if, uh, they're being assaulted and then I found that we have a, uh, loophole in our whole thing as far as when people go work for accepted offices, that we really didn't have a way to address that issue. Um, and I found that out personally cause this was done personally to me. And so, uh I, I'm very fortunate to be able to work with personnel. We got very smart people over there. So I have Mr richard Franks here and Miss Sylvia Sylvia-Donaldson, Sylvia-Donaldson, if you, uh if you two would sit at the uh the end of the table, they brought us some handouts and we're gonna learn about it. We're gonna learn about uh uh how to complain effectively in all branches of government. And I know that several people have to go over to make a, a quorum over in public safety. I'm gonna let you go because the alderman from the 18th is lurking outside, but get outside. And so we'll try not to go too fast. Oh my God, they're probably going 95% of this. We'll be back, ok? Even if you know it, it's a good refresher course. And the director will tell you I was 100 for 100 as an investigator, but all of us never lost an appeal. Ok, great. Ok, Mrs sylvia is our employee relations manager and in order to kind of give you a full scope of what she does. Again, her unit is responsible for um investigating any kinds of eeoc complaints that come in um or civil service employees, um complaints from the Missouri Commission on human rights. Um any kinds of department of labor issues. She also administers the citywide family medical leave program. She does all the drug and alcohol testing and will be meeting with all the woman thus, and myself and the police chief and um judge Jimmy Edwards next Tuesday to discuss updates and to get feedback. Um, she does a number of, of, of different duties in her capacity, but really, I think it's the most complex unit of the department of personnel. We have governing department of personnel, administrative regulations. Um who's not here today is uh Dale Jones. She's our training and organization development, uh manager. She makes sure that every single new employee has to go through the new employee orientation class and during that class, they are advised of their rights particularly. We hit these important ones with um the drug and alcohol policy with the people have to sign the form on, on uh initial uh employment and also about the harassment policy, the anti harassment policy. They, they are also given um instruction on the eeoc policy and a number of other policies. So they get that when they are first made employees. And of course, all these are online. In addition, we do supervisory training that is made mandatory and that is given frequently out of the next three months. July, August, September. Um, we're giving two classes. So we do that training. I will also say that because we have a lot of career, seasonal people or, or just seasonal people who come in the summer that aren't familiar with the city process. We tend to have a little bit more problems with them. So."
45,"Today is July. Ok, nice. Um, and welcome to our Village Greens Care staff meeting. Um, we are growing and, uh, I wanted to have, take an opportunity to just review who we are and what we're doing and, um, figure out next steps for, um, just growing and coordinating, but also just, I, I, I'm recording this so that, um, as I train new people or we have a substitute midwife that there's some record of, uh, how we get things done. Um, so we've been doing this since 2010. Pretty cool. Huh? And, um, Stephanie and Maeve have been instrumental in, did that come about? Um, especially Stephanie h the design binder. Um, the Winders worked out pretty well. It's been ok. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I wanted to ask you if you would be available or willing to expand it. Yeah. Ok. Yeah. Um, yeah, it would be nice. Um, if it had, I think it needs two more sections so that there's enough variety over sessions. What do you think? Um, one of the things that I did recently was to do this checklist? Um, oh, here, here's the checklist. Where's the set? It's a work in progress. And what what I'll do is um I also wanna walk us through, like, look looking at the space and just reminders of some of the details of setup and where things go, like where to find things, where to put things away and all of that. Um But before we do that, I just wanted to, to view our groovy mission statement. Ask you guys if you think there's anything there we should revise or change. So our team provides quality safe maternity care, facilitated support groups and education for parenting preparation and planned homebirth in a way that mothers and fathers can feel transformed by their experience. Welcoming new baby, able to say I was seen and heard and felt empowered by my care. Our values are respect above all else for client self determination, deep listening, we like to deliver while through service, maintain some humility, have fun and be a little weird. Um hold safety and quality of care above all else by having good communication, working as a team, knowing limitations, having robust practices and routines, we facilitate and mentor rather than teach or direct. It's a birthing from a fundamental principle by working as a team. Oh, no, I skip went backwards. Um like to maintain some flexibility and and awareness of compassion. I guess the compassion piece is, is like, you know, this understanding that we often don't know everything about a person's background, why they might be challenging or annoying or whatever and to put aside our expectations and judgments for that moment in order to serve that client better."
46,"So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know, you get started maybe a little slowly but you get enough done in the first week that with some heavier days later on, everything gets done and things stay civil and I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I, I would, uh, I would have it all ready to go. But then, then, then actually the paper would, would come along and then I would kind of do this and that would happen to every single paper, but then came my 90 page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. I knew for a paper like that. My normal workflow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light and I'd bump it up in the middle months and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear. It's like a little staircase. How hard could it be? Just walk up the stairs? No big deal. Right. The then funniest thing happened. Those first few months they came and went and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan and then, but then those middle months actually went by and I didn't really write words. And so we were here and then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks and one day I woke up with three days until the deadline. Still not having written a word. And so I did the only thing I could, I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours pulling not one but two all nighters, humans are not supposed to pull two, all nighters sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call and it's the school and they say, is this tim urban. And I say, yeah, and they say we need to talk about your thesis. And I say, ok, and they say it's the best one we've ever seen that did not happen. It was a very, very bad thesis. I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought this guy is amazing. No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer, blogger guy. I write the blog. Wait, but why? And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non procrastinators around me. And I wanted to explain to the non procrastinators of the world, what goes on in the heads of procrastinators and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non procrastinator. And so I could compare them. And I actually brought them here to show you today and I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. And I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look. OK. So here's the brain of a non procrastinator. Now, here's my brain, there is a difference. Both brains have a rational decision maker in them. But the procrastinator's brain also has an instant gratification monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. So the rational decision maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like that plan. So he actually takes the wheel and he says, actually let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya-Harding scandal because I just remember that that happened. Then, then we are gonna go over to the fridge, we gonna see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a youtube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. All of that's gonna take a while. So we're not gonna really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry. Now, what is going on here?"
47,"Looks like you're questioning some kilobyte usage that was done while in Canada, $0.002. Do you recognize that there is actually 00? Yes. Do you recognize there's a difference between those two numbers? $0.00 and 0.00. Yes. Is there a difference between them? They're both the same if you look at them on paper wise. No, they're not actually. So if you take 0.002 cents, remember it's cents times 35,000 896 $71.09. No, that would be 71 cents. How much should I be charged? By, by the way, this is calculated $71.79. You're paying 2/10 of a penny per kilobyte. 210, 2/10 of a penny would be 0.2 cents. You quoted me 0.002 cents. So which is the real re 0.002 0.002 what cents per kilobyte? So you just said it was 0.2 pennies and then you also said it's 0.002 cents. Those are two completely different numbers. They're 100 fold different. Ok. George. Hold on one second for me. Ok, this is Andrew. I'm a manager on the floor. How can I help you today? Hi. Do you recognize that there's a difference between $1.01? Definitely. Do you recognize there's a difference between half a dollar and half a cent? Definitely. Then do you therefore recognize there's a difference between $0.002 and 0.002 cents? Me, I'm teacher Matthew and I mean, I'm trying to get what you're saying here, but it's just not, and we're talking about sense. Right. Right. 0.002. If we multiply that by the amount of kyte usage that you have 3589335893, that comes out to what you paid 7179 cents. You never did the conversion from cents to dollars. I don't know. I'm not a mathematician. 0.002 cents times my 35,893 is a number, but it's still in cents. We're not quoting $0.002. We're quoting 0.002. 0 God, honestly, I mean, it's not opinion. Ok. Well, you know what, I'm going to post this recording on my blog and you want to do, that's what I want to do. And then you guys all at Verizon can learn"
48,"There can be some really great things about social media and it can be a really fantastic resource for young people and a great way for them to um connect with friends, seek support and seek good information. However, there is also uh research and evidence to say that some of the very narrow imaging and very careful presentations of messages, lifestyles and bodies on social media, particularly on Instagram, um can really um uh narrow young people's ideas as to um what their own bodies should look like and um what their own life should look like. Um And this can um very much feed into um you know, negative thoughts around self worth and can feed into feelings of low mood and also feeling anxious. I suppose the main presentations of mental health problems that we see includes anxiety and depression. We talk about them as high prevalence mental health problems because they're quite common for anxiety. Young people can experience intrusive thoughts that they have difficulty managing and can be very, very persistent and they can get stuck on those thoughts and that can make kind of sleep really difficult, it can make concentration very difficult, it can make relationships hard. We can see young people disconnecting from um friendship groups, uh and from activities that they've normally, um you know, quite enjoyed in terms of um uh low mood and depression. Um We can see uh that it, it can become a very, um whole of body experience and very overwhelming. Uh There can be impacts on sleeping patterns and feeling very, very lethargic, unable to get out of bed, unable to find motivation to do activities and tasks that young people have, you know, normally found quite easy um difficulty in concentrating, making decisions. Sometimes young people that are experiencing depression and low mood will talk about not feeling able to be on their own. What I do find um uh tricky and difficult is um posts and, and communities that are um coming from like a recovery focused um kind of messaging um particularly around body image um and disordered eating, um et cetera because sometimes there is a bit of blurring of the lines around um good messages around body image and um in a positive eating and um and sometimes what gets promoted as a healthy lifestyle is really um in a quite rigid eating and adherence to what sounds like a clean diet but is really not a balanced healthy diet, particularly for young people that are going through rapid growth and cognitive development. Those kind of communities and pages can be really risky. We were just starting to see the strength in the digital space in terms of being able to give young people a soft entry to support. And that's been um a really uh you know, great and valuable um thing that has happened through technology. Our main day to day work with young people is um uh you know, individual counseling. And so what we aim to do is is create a support plan that is tailored to the needs of the young person and best responds to what their goals are."
5,"While President Trump weighs his Supreme Court options. America's left is already acting apocalyptic. Take a look at this. We first have to find ways to stop that vote from having, find ways. What does that mean? Well, I'll, I'll join a million other people surrounding the United States Capitol, instead of circling the Capitol with a million people. Take the million people to Maine and go to LL Bean and tell them in Maine, you need to leave Maine unless Susan Collins votes the right way. That's how you play hard, hardball. You do it smart, you go to Alaska, you say, you know what all this Alaskan cruise, we're going to start boycotting Alaskan cruises if you're Senator. But to go back where there has been plenty of historical precedent, increase the court putting an additional justice on for every far right justice that's approved under the kind of rule. Again, it doesn't, the logic doesn't matter what the court will be looking at. Susan is precedent and there is precedent. One woman actually told me that she was an activist in the sixties and she had not been very active since then. And when she heard about Kennedy stepping down, she literally got physically ill. Keep in mind the people you just saw, don't even know who President Trump is going to nominate. Joining us. Now, with reaction is the author of the upcoming book, Why We Fight Recovering America's Will To Win Fox News, National Security strategist, Sebastian Gorka, former Democratic Congressman Dennis-Kucinich and Fox News contributor, Ari Fleischer. All right guys, I want to reference that, that video that we just saw where Michael Moore is calling for a million people to surround the US Capitol to prevent a Senate vote. And that's what it's for to prevent the vote. And now they're talking about getting companies to move out of states. If Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski don't vote the way they want. But the most interesting I thought was Tom-Rogers who talked about increasing the number of justices on the court for every conservative justice who was put on is there and I'm going to start with you, Ari, is there a, a any kind of precedent to assume that if a conservative justice dies, that only a conservative can replace him or if a swing justice is retires that we've got to put a swing person in there. Well, of course not. There isn't. And, and here's the beauty of our system judge and this is why I sleep so well at night, the reason Donald Trump can put whoever he wants on the, on the, on the Supreme court within reason and the Senate will confirm it is because the American people elected Donald Trump and a Republican Senate. If the American people had elected a democratic president and a Democratic Senate, the Democrat could have done that. These decisions are fundamentally made by the people and our system works. That's why Donald Trump is in this position. And when the Democrats talk about going to the extremes, they are a million people around the Capitol. Now, that's Michael Moore who said it, they're talking about subverting the system so they can save their version of the system that is not democratic, that is as wrong as wrong gets all right. And Dennis Kin, I mean, a democratic congressman, I mean, do you look at the Democrat party of today and say to yourself, wait a minute, they're talking about abolishing ice. We've got people who are actually out there opposing a nominee for the Supreme court justice when we don't even know who the person is. Well, judge. Um We have to keep in mind that Roe-v-Wade is definitely a flashpoint. You have millions of American women and men who stand with him are not going to be silent if a new Supreme court appointee favors cri criminalizing abortion. The Burger Court in 1973 declared that there was a right to privacy under due process uh on the 14th amendment. And I think that anything that goes beyond that balancing and creates an imbalance uh will cause people to mobilize all over the country. Well, and so, uh, Sebastian, I mean, what, what do you Sebastian Gorka, what do you say to that? The concept that, you know, they're gonna mobilize it? It's not as though any supreme court nominee is gonna get up there and say I support Roe-v-Wade or I don't support Roe-v-Wade or I'm gonna be an activist or I'm not, isn't it gonna all be based on decisions that have already been written and interpretations of those? You're the judge, you know, better than anybody. This is just scare tactics. They've been pulling this out since Bork's nomination in the 19 eighties, Roe-v-Wade, as you said, we don't even know who the president is going to nominate. This is the left. They, they disagree with democracy when it doesn't go their way and they understand the stakes involved here judge. If we have a conservative justice appointed and then voted in by the Senate, we will inoculate the Republic for at least a generation from the lunacy of the left, from the identity politics, the ideas that we don't need."
6,"There's breaking news tonight in the president's visit to the UK. And yes, it was something he said a front page tabloid interview hit right in the middle of his black tie dinner with the Prime Minister. And what he said about her could not have gone over. Well, that is just, uh that's just ahead. But first what he said before leaving the NATO summit earlier today in Brussels, as you may have heard, he took a victory lap on his push for other member nations to boost their defense spending from an agreed on 2% of their economies by 2024 to 4% for years. Presidents have been coming to these meetings and uh talked about the expense, the tremendous expense for the United States and uh tremendous progress has been made. Everyone's agreed to substantially up their commitment. They're going to up it at levels that they've never thought of before. Uh prior to last year where I attended my first meeting, it was going down, the amount of money being spent by uh countries was going down and down very substantially. And now it's going up very substantially and commitments were made. Uh only five of 29 countries were making their commitment. Uh And that's now changed, the commitment was a 2%. Ultimately, that will be going up quite a bit higher than that. So we are, uh we made a tremendous amount of progress today. Now, keeping them honest, the allies did not actually agree to boost their defense spending to 4%. Nor did they agree to immediately meet the 2024 target as President Trump demanded yesterday, French President Emmanuel Macron saying, quote, the communique is clear, it reaffirms a commitment to 2% in 2024. That is all nato's General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg saying merely that the President's direct approach had and I'm quoting here, quote, helped allies to really hear his message. Ok. It's a far cry from the president's suggestion that the allies bought into that message. In other words, whatever else, the summit accomplished. The one thing it did not accomplish is what the president took a victory lap over today. In many ways, the performance resembled the victory lap. He ran after his summit with Kim Jong Un. Only the Dana Mall came a bit quicker this time perspective. Now from Washington Post columnist and CNN global Affairs analyst, max Boot also Fareed Zakaria, host of Fareed Zakaria GPS max. I want to read part of the op ed today in the Washington Post that, that you wrote. You said you said President Trump likes his North Korea template. So much that he's applying it to NATO. Here's how it works. Ramp up the alarming rhetoric, escalate the crisis. Then hold a meeting act buddy, buddy claim that the problem is fixed because you're a master dealmaker, even though nothing has actually changed. Has, is that really what's happened here? I mean, that, that's how he left Brussels pretty much. I mean, it's the same, it's the same mo as you know, he went into the Singapore summit saying, you know, this is little rocket man and then he left, left Singapore saying that the problem is solved even though we realized the problem is not solved. Same thing. And in Brussels where he was attacking NATO for not spending enough on defense for Germany for having the Russian pipeline for gas, saying that Germany is a captive of Russia saying that, you know, we're crazy for paying for NATO. And then lo and behold, after two days of meetings, he emerged to say everything is great. I believe in NATO. Everything is they're spending more than ever before on defense problem solved. When in fact, nothing whatsoever had changed. All they basically did was reiterate their existing commitment to aim for 2% of GDP spending on defense by 2024 which is the exact same commitment they made in 2014. But all of a sudden, Trump claims this is a huge victory for his deal making. And I guess, you know, as he left Brussels, although European leaders were, were thought this was a bizarre and erratic performance. They were sort of thinking, well, it could have been worse. At least he left saying something nice about NATO instead of saying that he was going to pull out of it or pull us troops out of Germany, you know, Fareed. One of our guests last night said that they basically called the president a master of propagandist that he accuses Germany of being beholden to Russia when he himself is being accused of that, obviously, and then he's claiming that he got the pressured them to up their, their spending. But really, there's no new commitments on, on that. They reiterated commitments they'd already previously made. You know, it's the art of the New York hustle that is being applied to international relations. It's bullshit. It's bravado, it's braggadocio, you, you, you know, manufacture facts claim that the other side is weak claim that you've won, uh claim that the deal you have is the best deal in the history of the world. It's bizarre only because it's being applied by the President of the United States in the most important for the United States has created over the last 70 years for its security in NATO. But this is, you know, this is sort of the way I suppose this kind of New York real estate deal happens, you can tear your hair out about this because this has been going on now for you know, ever since Trump has been President."
7,"We asked you, uh, on Twitter, whether or not the handball is a penalty, it's close. But yet 53% said yes. Uh 47% said no. Uh This is what Dallach had to say after the game. The Croatian code said, I never speak about referees. But let me say this in a final, you don't give such a penalty, but it doesn't diminish France's victory. They deserve to win. And I congratulate them. Uh We asked a friend of the show, peter Walton, former premier league referee, what he thought of the decision. He said this is not a handball offense. The ball has hit the arm of the defender. However, the arm is in a natural position, the ball has traveled a very short distance and it does not look a deliberate act. Looking at a slow motion replay should be for a point of context. Only context is in full speed. The referee took too long at the monitor to convince me this was a clear and obvious error. Yeah, he wasn't sure. That's why he stood at that monitor for as long as he, he, he did. Uh, and the problem here with with penalty kicks across the board is, referees are making it up as they go along. Right? The handball law, they are making up game by game because it's ambiguous. It's an ambiguous law and it is so open to interpretation. It is scary. I thought this was never a penalty kick in a million years. Primarily because as a player in front of perisic, the hand comes up not above his head, but here in the act of jumping when you descend, the hand comes down, yes, it comes out. But you're not thinking as a player, I must keep my hands in a certain position. You have to have your hands at a certain, you can't have them tucked away. You can't have them behind you. You can't jump with them behind you. They have to be somewhere and he isn't enough. And everybody saying now the hand came out, he doesn't have enough time. He'd have to be the greatest goalkeeper in the world to know the player in front is going to miss the header and he makes that reaction. I just think it was, I honestly, I was shocked, it was given absolutely shocked. Uh I don't think it's handball. It changed the game as well because Croatia were at that point were dominating. They've just got the equalizer. I think it's a big decision from the referee. Uh and the fact that he went, he went to the monitor for a long time, he went to walk away and then went back again to have another look. So somebody obviously said something and he said, have a look at this angle, whatever angle you look at, it's not deliberate. I don't think it's a penalty. See, here's the problem. And so I, I don't think it's a penalty, right? And when you see it at full speed, it's not a penalty. And the referee saw it at full speed and it wasn't a penalty. And so then we go to VAR, you have the system in place and I've been saying all along, if you have the system in place, use it. Sure. OK. They use the system, the system here. Now put out in the referee's mind, his first judgment was this is not a penalty, then you go and see it. And I think what peter Walton said it there said it best at slow motion. It changes the perspective of what you think of this call because in slow motion, you lose what it is the perception of the distance between Blaise Matuidi and Ivan Pesic. And so you're thinking there is a chance for Petes to go up and then come down and then play the ball and this doesn't happen like that at full speed. So if you go into the monitor and you see it and you observe it, it is very difficult for a referee to then say no, it's not a handball. Once you see the slow motion replay, but that's not the way the game is played. The game is not played in slow motion. It is played at full speed and that's how the decision should have been made. It's not a penalty, but I sympathize with the referee because once he's, once he's called over and he sees it and obviously there is doubt in his mic. So it's not clear and obvious. He went, he went, he went, then we went to leave and came back. He didn't know himself, but he saw the little motion and was convinced by it. You're right here. Here's the pro you, you're right, Ali, here's the problem with and I like, I quite, I think Vars been super in this group. It's not, it's not all. Look, Vars never been wrong. Yes. The, the referee, we stop it but Vars there to help implement. So it's, it's not v that's making decisions. But here's the issue that I've got here because you're damned if you do if you're damned if you don't had had the 44 or five officials. However many has sat in the control room, had they not referred it to the referee. There would been an outcry, but in doing so, Ali makes the point is correct, in doing so they've literally stitched them up because they're just shoveling it on to him and saying, listen. And now in his mind he's thinking, well, they're telling me to look at this So they think it's a penalty. So it becomes convoluted in your own mind subconsciously. And I think that's the point that he got to. Whereas I think the four officials in the control room should have had a conversation between themselves quickly and said, look, this is not a penalty. We'll just take it completely out of the ref's control and we'll turn to play the game on uh briefly gab, all I wanted to say was they did have a conversation amongst themselves. So that's what they do. I agree with Craig. That wasn't a penalty. But there's another situation where they would call the referee over and that is if he hasn't seen it. So, I think the likeliest situation, hopefully we'll find out exactly what happened."
8,"We know who the real heavyweights are in the West three titles in four years. How far away now are the Lakers from Golden State? There are two seasons this season, they'll make the playoffs. They should advance and if they get another piece, they should advance plenty, but they're not going to beat Golden State. I don't think first year out the following season provided they get Kawhi Leonard by hook or by Crook, either by trade now or particularly in Stephen A's scenario. If they simply sign him and retain their young developing pieces, I think they beat Golden State the very next year. Guys recall that Golden State a 73 win team, but very much the kind of postmodern, you know, ball handler is also the scorer, Steph-Curry spacing the floor. Draymond Green. The big plays five out like the prototypical postmodern team. If you will, that still doesn't beat those dominant two way wings. I brought it up in the last segment. 73 win team lost to a LeBron James Cleveland Cavaliers team and as great as Kyrie Irving is he ain't Kawhi Leonard. You put Kawhi Kawhi is like a souped up Scottie Pippen in the sense that he plays defense just as well, but he's an even more efficient offensive player. You give LeBron James his Scottie Pippen, but that dude is bigger and better or at least better and you have more parts because they didn't get Paul George. But who's to say they won't wind up with Ken Walker or I mentioned Clint Capela or someone else really good or king and Kuzma, one of those two developed into a real good player. I'm sorry. It took the Warriors adding that great two way wing to that team to overcome LeBron LeBron and Kawhi together will not be denied. And if they get Kawhi, the Warriors have this year coming up but not the following one, the Lakers will win that year 2019. It's interesting because obviously, um I believe that the Warriors going, uh are the favorites to win it all next year again. I don't think anybody can beat them, but it's not as far off as you think it's not beyond the pale that bought the, the Golden State Warriors could get knocked off next year. We gotta remember, we saw some vulnerability in the Golden State Warriors. This past season, we saw uh injuries uh to Kevin Durant at one point, Klay Thompson and another, obviously, Steph-Curry, we saw that we also saw uh teams figuring them out but just knowing that you really, really couldn't stop them because they were extensively explosive. But the run for their money that was given to them by the Houston Rockets. If Houston could push you to seven games, if they could blow you out a game or two in the series or what have you, who's to say that the Lakers can't, particularly when you look at the, uh, the Western Conference and you look at Portland, Utah, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, Minnesota, et cetera. You've got these teams going on. The Lakers are right in the middle of all of that. The West is certainly a situation where you can beat up, you can beat each other up and somehow some way you can force someone to appear to be more vulnerable than they've ever been in the past. And so, even though I'm gonna give the Golden State Warriors the edge and believe that again, they should be the prohibitive favorite and it's undeniable. What I'm not gonna let go of is the possibility that they could get knocked off this upcoming year. We can talk about Kawhi. All right. But the reality of the situation is is that when you look at some of these other teams, it might not be necessary. I wouldn't be surprised at all if I found the Los Angeles Lakers in a conference finals against the Golden State Warriors next year here because I think the loss of Trevor Ariza in Houston is going to be huge, losing him. You lose a guy that could spot up and shoot but he's also one of your elite defenders. And I think that you can't underestimate the significance of his loss. So it could get very, very interesting in the West. I'm gonna give Golden State the edge. I'm not refuting anything that you're saying. Max, I just don't think it's as simple as you try to make it out to be cause I think a lot of warriors before you jump in, I just want to add this to piggyback on your point. Stephen A I have Westgate Las Vegas, their odds here. They have the Warriors as the favorites. Obviously 10 to 11. Then Celtics and Lakers tied for 7 to 2 followed by the Rockets. So I found that surprising, they feel like they obviously have a shot to be in the finals there as well. I definitely think the Lakers and the Boston Celtics are on the same, on the same level with looking up at Golden State, but Boston is right there. I think Boston is ahead of them right now. I think as I like Ingram and Kuzma a lot, I think Alonzo if he gets the shot is a real good player. Other parts of his game is already are already very advanced for his age and his experience. But the Boston Celtics guys the starting five. If they do nothing else, Kyrie Hayward Jalen Brown Tatum, Al Horford, it's ridiculous. And right now the only reason we'd even consider the Lakers in the same, you know, level around the Boston Celtics."
9,"For over a decade on streets and in bars and in living rooms from Rio to Reykjavik and everywhere in between the debate has raged Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo who is the greatest player in the world. The truth is we've never seen a rivalry like this, not in football, not in any of our major sports, but that debate might soon be over and it might end without Messi or Ronaldo getting the trophy. They so glaringly lack the World Cup to understand why it matters that two individuals haven't won a team trophy that's only up for grabs every four years. You have to know just how dominant Messi and Ronaldo have been. The winner is from 2008 through 2017. The ballad d'or basically the sport's most valuable player award has gone to either Ronaldo or Messi five for Ronaldo five for Messi, none for anyone else. It's not just balls for Messi and Ronaldo Messi is the all time leading scorer in La Liga in the Spanish Super Cup in El Clasico. He's Barcelona's all time leading scorer in goals in all competitions in European competitions in goals in a calendar year. He scored 613 overall. 100 in Champions League. 61 for Argentina 48 in the Copa del Rey. In other words, he puts up numbers. So does Ronaldo who is the all time leader in Champions League goals and real Madrid's all time leader in La Liga goals. He scored 84 in the premier league, 81 for Portugal, 653 goals overall, but it's not just about individual success for these two. Messi's teams have won 32 club trophies. Ronaldo's teams have won 27 club trophies. All of this makes the lack of a World Cup that much more striking. Sure, football is a team sport. It requires coaching, form depth and a healthy dose of timing and serendipity but Messi and Ronaldo aren't from historically struggling football nations. So why haven't the two been able to lift soccer's most coveted prize? Let's start with Rinaldo. It was 2006 in Germany and a 21 year old Ronaldo helped Portugal to an unbeaten record in group D after a red cart filled 10 win over the Netherlands in the round of 16. Ronaldo had one of his finest world Cup moments slotting home the winning penalty in a scoreless quarter final versus David Beckham's England. Ronaldo in Portugal would go no further. The squad ran into Zinedine Zidane Thierry, Henri and France who won 10 and reached what became an infamous final versus Italy. Sadly, for Ronaldo. That has been the peak of his world cup career in South Africa in 2010. Portugal managed just one victory 70 versus North Korea as they finished second behind Brazil in group g despite taking a 19 match up, beaten run into the knockout stage and a perfect defensive record in the world cup. Portugal ran into their Iberian Peninsula rivals, Spain and their golden generation David Villa scored Spain advanced won the whole thing while Portugal went back home again. 2014 was even more disappointing. Portugal were stuck with another powerhouse in the group stage this time professional champion Germany and they lost 40 in the opening match for demons. Then it got worse facing the United States in the second match, Portugal had to settle for a last gasp 22 draw to keep their dreams of reaching the knockout stage alive for one more game. Then despite Ronaldo's 80 th minute winner versus Ghana in the final match, Portugal couldn't overturn U Sas goal to its advantage. Eight years after being reasonably close to the final, Portugal didn't even reach the knockouts. Messi meanwhile has gone in a different direction. 2006 is a relatively unknown teenager. He emerged off the Argentine bench and gave a proper introduction to the footballing world scoring a goal in their second group stage game against Serbia and Montenegro Messi came on again late in Argentina's 21 extra time win over Mexico in the round of 16 but stayed on the bench as the Al Celeste were eliminated by Germany via penalties in the quarter finals. In 2010. Messi was a known quantity and it was perhaps his most disappointing World Cup coached by the iconic Diego Maradona Messi struggled to make a major impression in the build up even so the squad was perfect in group B and hopes Raha Messi would seize the moment in the knockout stage. He did it after a 31 round of 16 win against Mexico. Messi's group fell well short in the quarter finals falling 40 again to Germany then came 2014 in Brazil. The heartbreak led by Javier Macherano. The Argentine defense was stout Messi got back to scoring two, scoring the eventual winner in the 21 opener against Bosnia and her Covina."
