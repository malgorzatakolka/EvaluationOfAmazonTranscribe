Let's bring in Phil Mackie, who is there at the palace. We're looking at Theresa and Philip May. Philip, can you see how he's being transferred from the helicopters?

It looks like, as you said, the Beast. It's got its headlights on, because the sun is beginning to set now. It's certainly sinking behind some clouds. It's about a quarter of a mile away down the grand drive leading up into the courtyard, so you've seen the pictures there of the Prime Minister and her husband, Philip May. They are now awaiting the arrival. I can see that the limousine itself is still parked. I can't see any movement in the distance there to see whether or not the President is on his way. This is running a little bit late, I think you probably noticed, Cathy and Christian. We were expecting this to have happened a good 15 minutes or so ago, which means that all the VIPs, members of the cabinets, the business leaders have had to stand there for about 20 minutes. It's not a cold evening by any means, but nonetheless, they'll probably be getting a little bit fed up of waiting for the President.

But we have also seen the American press corps arrive in minibuses a short time ago, just in time to witness this scene, which will look rather spectacular, I think, because it does look absolutely stunning. Looking down that long drive towards where the President's limousine is currently still parked, I'm afraid to say, and beyond that, the statue of the Duke of Marlborough, who built, or had Blenheim Palace built for him thanks to a gift from the nation after his success in the Wars of the Spanish Succession just over 300 years ago. Lots of lenses, long lenses pointed in that direction, but still no sign, I'm afraid, of any movement from the limousine. It looks like the Prime Minister and Philip May are going to have to wait a little bit longer.

Yeah. If I am the Number 10's communication shop or the White House's communication shop, I'm giving myself a pat on the back this evening with these images, because they are spectacular. The lighting ... There you go. The Prime Minister and her husband Philip May also color coordinated with the guardsmen, the guardsmen all standing there. It couldn't look more perfect for them, could it, Phil?

It's absolutely stunning, and if you think about it, this isn't an official state visit, so what better place to come than the only non-royal palace and the only palace not either owned by the monarchy or by the church, so this is the only other palace that could come. But you still get this magnificent Baroque palace, beautiful landmark, well-known throughout this country, absolutely there with the mast brands of the household divisions standing to attention, ready for the arrival of the President. It looks, it's just exactly what Donald Trump wants it, and it's probably as close to a state visit as you could have. In fact, the four trumpeters, the state trumpeters of the hustle cavalry are only ever deployed when the royal family is present, or when there is a head of state, so again, it's just about state visit, except it's not happening at Windsor Castle, and there isn't even more pomp and circumstance, but I suspect for the American audiences, this is plenty enough.

As we just wait for the car, we should just spell out what's gonna happen tomorrow, because the meat of the visit, of course, is tomorrow, so in the morning, they're gonna go to a military base to see a joint exercise between U.S. and U.K. special forces who have worked together before, tackling Islamic terrorism, and they're gonna be given a show tomorrow when they go to that, and then in the afternoon, they're going to lot for lunch at Chequers, the country residence of the Prime Minister, of course, and while they're there, there's gonna be substantial talks not only about trade, but also about security, as well. And presumably that is where they're gonna be talking a lot about the trade deal, and I would suspect that there will be senior members of the cabinet there, maybe even Dominic Raab, who is of course the new Brexit secretary, new to the job, but very important in not only what is going on with Europe, but also with the United States.

And there you go, you can see the Beast coming up the hill-

So Christian, here we now have the pictures of-

... to the palace.

You're seeing it, too. Yeah, the pictures of the Beast coming up the hill. I was just starting to think that they were making the Prime Minister wait a little uncomfortably long before they actually turned up, but here, look at that, the Beast roaring over the horizon into the courtyard at Blenheim Palace with the British and the American flags flying, the President inside. If you want a projection of power around the world, there are few better ways to do it than to turn up in this particular car.

And Joes, while we're watching this, he's going to see the Queen tomorrow. How many of the Presidents has she met? Do you know? I mean, I think there's only one. Am I right? LBJ, that she did meet.

She certainly didn't meet Lyndon Johnson, but she has, I think, a mercurial track record- ",Trump arrives at Blenheim Palace - BBC News,04:57,00:45,TRUE

Each of them, remember, has to be pulled through the cave by expert divers. It is such a risky and complicated operation. So let's take you straight there to Tham Luang. Our correspondent Dan Johnson is there. Uh and Dan, signs of ambulances with sirens going. Tell us what you've witnessed in the past few minutes or so.
Yes. The 9th ambulance just left here and headed away down the road taking another of the boys to hospital. So that's a sign that the rescue mission that was restarted again this morning is continuing in a successful way. And we understand that further up that road by the cave entrance, there are two more boys who've been brought to the surface and are just being checked over. They will be put into ambulances shortly and driven away to a hospital, too. That would mean there's only one more boy and their 25-year-old coach left in the cave still to be rescued. We understand that rescue operation is underway. The officials in charge said this morning that they were confident in the experience that they've gained over the last two days of bringing these boys out that they could complete this rescue operation today and make sure that everyone is safe.
But even when the boys and their coach are out there, there are still other people to follow. There's a doctor who's been in there treating them for the last few days. He has to be brought to safety, along with three of the Royal Thai Navy divers who were the first team to actually reach the boys eight days ago now. They were the ones who discovered them alive deep under that hillside in the furthest depths of that cavern and those three navy divers who've been with them for the last eight days. So they themselves as part of the rescue team have now gone through something of an ordeal, and everyone's aware that they have to be brought to safety, too. So it looks like this rescue operation is now reaching a conclusion and it's so far been thoroughly successful. Let's hope that continues.
Indeed, Dan. As each of the boys come out and there is news of that, what is the atmosphere like? D do you feel the growing sense of euphoria there that this has all gone so well?
Yes, you can feel the tension being shed off in layers with each ambulance that comes out, with each confirmation we get that another boy is safe and is on his way to hospital now.
Some of the parents have been keeping a vigil up by the cave entrance ever since this ordeal started 18 days ago. Most of those were moved to the main town to Chiang Rai a couple of days ago when officials said this rescue attempt was going to begin. So they're waiting at the hospital although they haven't been able to be reunited yet even with the boys who are already safe. There are lots of safety checks, health checks to be carried out to make sure those boys are all right, to assess exactly what impact this ordeal has had on their physical well-being and their mental health as well. So everyone knows that there is a lot more still to do but the relief is certainly pouring across the fields here that are covered in the world's media because the eyes of everyone around the globe have been on the entrance of that cave waiting for these boys to emerge. Well, it looks like we don't have to wait much longer until they're all out.
Indeed, Dan. I wonder if those boys who have been rescued just realize how many people have been watching the entrance of this cave, wishing them well from all over the world. We know one of them has asked for chocolate which seemed to me to be a great sign. Do we know if any of them have been talking yet about their experiences about what they've actually been through as they were brought out of the cave?
We were told this morning by the medics who are in charge of treating them that the boys, the eight who are in hospital, overnight are all set up and are responsive. We've not been told much about what they've been saying but as you said, some of them have been asking for their favorite food. They may not be able to have that yet because their digestive systems have to readjusted having not eaten properly for more than two weeks. They didn't eat at all really for 10 days while they were stuck alone in darkness and they've only really had soft food, drinks and uh protein gels over the last few days, and even once they're out, they can't just start eating solid food again. So I'm not sure the chocolate request will be fulfilled any time soon, and they're not even allowed their favorite spicy food yet. It's going to take some time for these boys to get back to normality after what they've been through.
We can't see them through the windows of the ambulances which are blacked out. But we don't know if they can see us. That might be the first glimpse they get of the line of cameras that is here bringing these pictures to people around the world, letting the world know that they are finally safe after everything they've been through. I'm sure they'll get an appreciation of that over the next few days.
They have an invite to the World Cup final. FIFA has said there are seats there for them if they can get to safety and if they feel up to it. But the medics this morning said that they need at least a week in hospital. They're weakened after what they've been through. They've lost weight. They've got all sorts of different ways in which they need to readjust after this. So I don't think we'll see them at the World Cup the doctor said they'll be watching it on TV though because they are a football team. That's their passion that brought them together. They went in that cave as a team and hopefully by the end of today they'll be reunited even if it is in hospital.
That's great to have such good news, Dan.",Thailand Cave rescue: '11th person brought out' - BBC News,05:04,00:00,TRUE

I'm not going to open it. I tell him. Okay

So I'm I'm wondering about that. Do you see not see a value in tracking? 
Do I see the value in tracking?
Value in tracking? 
I see the value in tracking. He can go ahead and go look and track. 
Okay. 
But I'm not going to sit there and give him an explanation of what I just purchased. 
So is it your position that you're operating within the budget with these purchases? 
That why I answer him no. No - yes and no. 
Okay. 
Yes, because I use my account. But at the same token, no, I don't operate with the budget, because it's not something that we've planned on. If we hmm already did the groceries, then he's questioning, ""Well, why did you have to go back to to the grocery store again?"" 
Okay. So this purchase in your mind might be an extra. 
Like we already have
It is an extra. 
 food in the house. We already have clothes. 
It is an extra. You go to the house okay and there's food. It might not be the food they want to eat at that moment, -
Sure. 
... but there's plenty of food. 
Okay. 
And that's where you know my growing up, my background is completely different from hers. I you know I'm Cuban. I come from a country. I never had anything. 
Mm-hmm 
So to me -
Mm. Correct that. Correct it.
Well, it's not that I didn't have anything. 
Thank you. 
But I didn't have everything I wanted. 
There. 
Okay. 
And me growing up, I didn't have everything either. 
Maybe the thing to do is to view the budget as a living document. It's not something that's cut in stone. Things happen and you need to have potentially weekly or monthly or quarterly meetings to revise the budget. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, that's not ... I don't like talking. I set the budget. We set the budget. We sit down every January. 
Beginning of the year, yeah. 
Okay. 
And we set the budget for the year. And it's gotta match at December or I'll go crazy. 
I'm wondering if you agree that the budget is what it needs to be, because of the exercise you went through in January and it was in your best interest to stay within these parameters. Okay? 
Yeah, we leave everything.
Okay so if that's the agreement. Then in any particular month, if for some reason you exceeded the budget in let's say the food area, then you have to consider that you no longer have the opportunity to do that in the following month and something has to give. Maybe you don't go to the movies or maybe the kids don't have snacks and you make cookies that that month. 
And I'm I'm okay with that. But then, Jackie is not willing to ... and I get it, to make the kids suffer for a bad decision. 
Oh, okay. 
Well, Yeah I have more of an emotional attachment. 
It has to be done on a developmentally appropriate basis but children should be learning about these dec decisions. These choices. 
Oh yes. Knock on wood. Thank God. I know my kids they don't throw themselves on the floor in the

right
if they don't get their stuff. That's one thing that we taught them. 
So maybe they'll understand a conversation where ""Gee, we did all these fun things last month. This is the month we have to step back and not do those things."" I think you can model that for them and you'll you know reap the benefits when they're older. 
But as Jean was about to find out, Jackie and Manuel's arguments about the budget are rooted in their own childhood experiences. 
His family was more dynamics of what the dad said went. In my dynamics it was more was like what my dad said went. My mom would give a little rebuttal but then she would give in. And I hated that and I would always argue with my mom, like why do I have to make that why do you - why do you have to go get him a glass of water? He's right next to the kitchen. I don't want to do that. 
I can see how this is a trigger for you. But when you think about it, do you really feel like you're not being heard by Manuel? Are you getting
Sometimes I do and he knows it 'cause I tell him like every time we get into an argument about this. 
Okay. 
It's like every time it has to be something with money, it's my fault. And so he says, ""Well."" Kind of like if the shoes fits, wear it. So, you know that but the that's why I feel controlled.

It's important to validate that this is what she's experiencing so -
But how am I go to follow somebody else's mistake? Let me make my own. 
But when you make the mistake and I explain it to you, you don't change it. The next time we have a financial issue, it's the same thing. ""Well, I don't understand. Why did you spend so much?""

Senator, does it give you any comfort that in uh Judge Kavanaugh's writing in 2009 when he was saying that uh indicting and prosecuting a president would be uh bad for the country, that he kept saying repeatedly throughout the article that, ""only you in Congress can prevent that,"" that only Congress can pass a bill to uh basically defer any prosecutions of the president until after the president leaves office. 
Now the part that worries me most is he keeps talking about what a disaster it would be for the country, and ultimately, the Supreme Court is going to have to make law in areas where we don't have precedent. And in other opinions, Judge Kavanaugh has already made clear he's willing to put his own judgment in and to put his judgment on the line, and if he thinks that it would be a disaster for Donald Trump to be indicted, he looks like somebody who could very much be on Trump's side. And what's so worrisome about all of this is he very well could be the deciding vote in whether or not a criminal prosecution against the president goes forward.
Look, I get it. We're looking ahead, but this is a president right now who hears the hoof beats of an investigation that is bearing down on him. The Mueller investigation has been going forward. It has already produced multiple indictments, multiple guilty pleas, and all of the threads keep tying back to Donald Trump himself, and that's a real problem. And Donald Trump is nothing, if not a man who protects first and foremost Donald Trump.
Would you suggest uh to uh Democrats or opponents of the nomination that the the place to go to work is in Maine and Alaska to try to uh get the votes of your Republican colleagues there, the only two uh Republican senators who are pro-choice?
Look, the way I see this is nobody makes it to the Supreme Court without a majority in the United States Senate, and I think people all across this country need to raise their voices. Ah always keep in mind on this. We didn't have the votes to protect the Affordable Care Act. We didn't have em. 
I remember the day after Donald Trump was sworn in, thinking about the fact that now the Republicans control the House, control the Senate, control the White House, they can roll back Obamacare next week, and I really feared they would do it. But people across this country raised their voices, and it got bigger and it got louder and bigger and louder. And it was Democrats, it was Republicans, it was Independents. 
People made their voices heard. And ultimately when they did that, we got enough Republicans to cross the aisle and to save health care for tens of millions of Americans. You know that is the remarkable part about a democracy. We raise our voices. We can all still be held heard in Washington, and for me, that's what this is about right now, raising our voices, all of us. We need to speak up like we've never spoken up before. This is the time. 
I'm sure there will be questions in the judiciary committee, especially from Democrats, about  uh the rights of children who are being held uh yes at the Southern border, some of whom you were able to visit  whe when you went down there. Uh, Judge Kavanaugh has already ruled in in that arena. Last fall NBC News reports that Judge Kavanaugh wrote a decision siding with the Trump administration lawyers to block a migrant teenager in Texas from being released from custody to receive an abortion. Uh he tried to prevent that. He was overruled by his own colleagues uh on the circuit court of appeals, and then he complained that his colleagues were creating a right to what he called yes abortion on demand for girls in that situation. 
Yeah. You know, I -I was just down there two weeks ago yesterday, down on the border, and what I saw was deeply shocking.

We first have to find ways to stop that vote from happening. 
Find ways? What does that mean? 
Well, 
Like what?
I'll I'll I'll join a million other people surrounding the United States Capitol. 
Instead of circling the capital with a million people, take the million people to Maine, and go to LL Bean and tell them in Maine, you need to leave Maine unless Susan Collins votes the right way. That's how you play hardball. You do it smart. You go to Alaska. You say, you know what, all those Alaskan Cruise? We're gonna start boycotting Alaskan cruises if your Senator votes the wrong way. 
She said
But to go back where there has been plenty of historical precedent, increase the court, putting an additional Justice on for every far-right Justice that's approved under the kind of rules - 
Again, it does it it it - the logic doesn't matter, what the court will be looking at, Susan, is precedent. And there is precedent. 
One woman actually told me that she was an activist in the sixties, and she had not been very active since then, and when she heard about Kennedy stepping down she literally got physically ill.
Keep in mind the people you just saw don't even know who President Trump is going to nominate. Joining us now with reaction is the author of the upcoming book, Why We Fight: recovering America's will to win. Fox News National Security strategist Sebastian Gorka. 
Former Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich, and Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer.
Alright guys, I, I want to reference that, uh, that that video that we just saw, where Michael Moore is calling for a million people to surround the US Capitol to prevent a Senate vote. And that's what it's for, to prevent the vote. And now they're talking about getting companies to move out of states if Susan uh Collins or uh, Lisa Murkowski don't vote the way they want.
But the most interesting, I thought, was uh Tom Rodgers, who talked about increasing the number of justices on the court, for every conservative justice who was put on. Is there, and I'm going to start with you, Ari, is there a a any kind of precedent to assume that if a conservative justice dies, that only a conservative can replace him. Or if a swing justice is retires, that we've got to put a swing person in there?
Well, of course not, there isn't, and here's the beauty of our system, Judge, and this is why I sleep so well at night. The reason Donald Trump can put whoever he wants on the on the on the Supreme Court, within reason, and the Senate will confirm it, is because the American people elected Donald Trump and a Republican Senate. If the American people had elected a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate, the Democrat could have done that.
These decisions are fundamentally made by the people, and our system works. That's why Donald Trump is in this position. And when the Democrats talk about such going to the extremes they are, a million people around the Capitol? Now, that's Michael Moore who said it. Thet're talking about subverting the system, so they can save their version of the system. That is not democratic. That is as wrong as wrong gets.
All right, and Dennis Kucinich, I mean, Democratic Congressman. I mean, do you look at the Democrat Party of today, and say to yourself, ""Wait a minute. They're talking about abolishing ICE. We've got people who are actually out there opposing a nominee for the Supreme Court Justice, when we don't even know who the person is.""
Well, Judge, we have to keep in mind that Roe v. Wade is definitely a flashpoint. You have millions of American women, and men who'll stand with them, are not going to be silent if a new Supreme Court appointee favors crimin criminalizing abortion. The Berger Court, in 1973, declared that there was a right to privacy, under due process, uh the Fourteenth Amendment. I think that anything that goes beyond that balancing, and creates an imbalance, will cause people to mobilize all over the country.
Well, and so, Sebastian, I mean, what do you ... Sebastian Gorka, what do you say to that, the concept that you know they're going to mobilize? It's not as though as any Supreme Court nominee is going to get up there, and say, ""I support Roe v. Wade, or I don't support Roe v. Wade""? Or, ""I'm gonna be an activist,"" or ""I'm not""? Isn't it going to all be based on decisions that have already been written, and interpretations of those?
You're the judge. You know better than anybody. This is just scare tactics. They've been pulling this out since Bork's nomination in the nineteen eighties. Roe - Roe v. Wade, as you said, we don't even know who the President is going to nominate. This is the left. They they disagree with democracy, when it doesn't go their way, and they understand the stakes involved here, Judge.

6,Unscripted Broadcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aFgcae43qE,"There's breaking news tonight on the President's visit to the UK, and yes, it was something he said. A front page tabloid interview hit right in the middle of his black tie dinner with the Prime Minister, and what he said about her could not have gone over well. That is just uh - that's just ahead, but first, what he said before leaving the NATO summit earlier today in Brussels. As you may have heard, he took a victory lap on his push for other member nations to boost their defense spending from an agreed-on 2% of their economies by 2024, to 4%.
For years, presidents have been coming to these meetings and uh talked about the tremendous expense for the United States, and tremendous progress has been made. Everyone's agreed to substantially up their commitment. They're going to up it at levels that they've never thought of before. Prior to last year, when I attended my first meeting, it was going down. The uh amount of money being spent by uh countries was going down, and going down very substantially, and now it's going up very substantially. And commitments were made. Only five of 29 countries were making their commitment and that's now changed. The commitment was at 2% ultimately, that'll be going up quite a bit higher than that. So we are, uh, we made a tremendous amount of progress today.
Now, keep an honest - the allies did not actually agree to boost their defense spending to 4%, nor did they agree to immediately meet the 2024 target, as President Trump demanded yesterday. French President Emmanuel Macron saying, quote, ""The communique is clear. It reaffirms a commitment to 2% in 2024. That is all."" NATO's General Secretary, Jens uh Stoltenberg saying merely that the President's direct approach had, and I'm quoting here, quote, ""helped allies to really hear his message."" Okay. It's a far cry from the President's suggestion that the allies bought into that message. In other words, whatever else the summit accomplished, the one thing it did not accomplish is what the President took a victory lap over today. In many ways the performance resembled the victory lap he ran after his summit with Kim Jong-un, only the denouement came a bit quicker this time. 
Perspective now from Washington Post columnist and CNN global affairs analyst Max Boot, also Fareed Zakaria, host of Fareed Zakaria GPS. 
Max, I want a report of the op-ed today in the Washington Post that that you wrote. You said - you said President Trump likes his North Korea template so much, that he's applying it to NATO. Here's how it works. Ramp up the alarming rhetoric, escalate the crisis, then hold a meeting, act buddy-buddy, claim that the problem is fixed because you're a master deal maker even though nothing has actually changed. Has - is that really what's happened here? I mean, that - that's how he left Brussels?
Pretty much, I mean it's the same - it's the same MO as you know, he went into the Singapore summit saying, you know, ""This is Little Rocket Man,"" and he left Singapore saying that the problem is solved, even though we realize the problem is not solved. Same thing in uh in Brussels, where he was attacking uh NATO for not spending enough on defense, for Germany for having the Russian pipeline for gas, saying that Germany's a captive of Russia, saying that you know we're crazy for paying for NATO. Then lo and behold, after two days of meetings he emerged to say, ""Everything is great. I believe in NATO. Everything is they're spending more than ever before on defense. Problem solved,"" when in fact, nothing whatsoever had changed.
All they uh basically did was reiterate their existing commitment to aim for 2% of GDP spending on defense by 2024, which is the exact same commitment they had made in 2014. But all of a sudden Trump claims this is a huge victory for his deal-making, and I guess, you know, as he left Brussels, although European leaders were were - thought this was a bizarre and and  erratic performance, uh they were sort of thinking, ""Well, it could have been worse. At least he left saying something nice about NATO, instead of saying that he was going to pull out of it, or pull US troops out of Germany.""
You know, Fareed, one of our guests last night said, basically called the President a master propagandist, that he accuses Germany of being beholden to Russia, uh when he himself is being acc- accused of that, obviously. And then he's claiming that he got that he pressured them to up their spending, but really there's no new commitments on on that. They reiterated commitments they'd already previously made.
You know, it's the art of the New York hustle that is being applied to international relations. It's bullshit, it's bravado, it's braggadocio. You you you manufacture facts, claim that the other side is weak, claim that you've won, claim that the deal you have is the best deal in the history of the world. It's bizarre, only because it's being applied by the President of the United States in the most important forum the United States has created over the last 70 years for its security, NATO.

This is what Dallach had to say after the game the the Croatian coach said, ""I never speak about referees but let me say this: in a final you don't give such a penalty, but it doesn't diminish France's victory. They deserve to win and I congratulate them."" We asked friend of the show Peter Walton former premier league referee, what he thought of the decision. He said, ""This is not a handball offense. The ball has hit the arm of the defender, however the arm is in a natural position. The ball has traveled a very short distance, and it does not look a deliberate act. Looking at a slow motion replay should be for point of context only, context is in full speed. The referee took too long at the monitor to convince me this is a clear and obvious error.""
Yeah, he wasn't sure. That's why he stood at that monitor for as long as he he did. And the problem here with penalty kicks across the board is referees are making up as they go along, right? The handball law they are making up game by game because it's ambiguous. It's an ambiguous law and it is so open to interpretation it is scary. I thought this was never a penalty kick in a million years, primarily because the player in front of Paris Hitch.
Your hand comes up not above his head but here in the act of jumping. When you descend the hand comes down, yes it comes out but you're not thinking as a player, I must keep my hands in a certain position. You have to have your hands at set you can't have them tucked away, you can't have them behind you, you can't jump with them behind you. They have to be somewhere. And he is an I never really say the hand doesn't he doesn't have enough time. He'd have to be the greatest goal keeper in the world to know the player in front is going to miss the header, and he makes that reaction. I just think it was, honestly I was shocked it was given.
Absolutely shocked, I don't think it's handball. It changed the game as well, because Croatia at that point were dominating they had just got the equalizer. Yeah. I think it's a big decision from the referee, and the fact that he went he went to the monitor for a long time, he went to walk away, and then went back again to have another look. So someone obviously said something, ""Did you have a look at this angle."" Whatever angle you look at it's not deliberate I don't think it's a penalty.
See here's the problem and so I I don't think it's a penalty, right? And when you see it at full speed it's not a penalty, and the referee saw it at full speed, and it wasn't a penalty. So then we go to VAR. You have this system in place, and I've been saying all along, ""If you have the system in place, use it."" So okay they use the system, the system here now put doubt in the referee's mind. His first judgment was, this is not a penalty. Then you go and see it, and I think what Peter Wilton said said it there said it best. At slow motion, it changes the perspective of what you think of this call. Because in slow motion you lose what it is the perception of the distance between placement between Blaise Matuidi and Ivan Perišić, and so your thinking there is a chance for Perišić to go up, and then come down, and then play the ball, and this doesn't happen like that at full speed.
So if you go into the monitor and you see it, and you observe it, it is very difficult for a referee to then say, ""No it's not a handball."" Once you see the slow motion replay. But that's not the way the game is played, the game is not played in slow motion it's played at full speed, and that's how the decision should have been made. It's not a penalty but I sympathize with the referee, because once he once he's called over, and he sees it and obviously there is doubt in his mind. So it's not clear and obvious. He went, he went, he went and then he went to leave, and came back. He didn't know himself, but he saw the slow motion and was convinced by it.
You're right, here's a problem, you're right Ali here's has a problem with, and I like VAR quite a lot - I think VAR's been super in this. Good Look no, no. VAR's never been wrong.
Yeah it's the referee.
Referee we've stopped there but VAR's here to help implement, so it's not VAR that's making decisions. But here's the issue that I've got here, because you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. Had had the four, four or five officials, however many as sat it the control room. Had they not referred it to the referee, there would've been an outcry. But in doing so, Ali makes the point and it's correct. In doing so they've literally stitched him up, because they have to shove it onto him and say, ""Listen."" And now in his mind he's thinking, ""Well they're telling me to look at this, so they think it's apparently -"" So it becomes convoluted in your own mind subconsciously, and I think that's the point that he got to. Whereas I think the four officials in the control room should've had a conversation between themselves quickly and said, ""Look this is not a penalty. We'll just take it completely out of the ref's control, and we'll play the game on.""
Uh, briefly Gav
all I wanted to say was they did have a conversation amongst themselves, that's what they do. I I agree with Craig that probably wasn't a penalty, but there's another situation where they would call the referee over, and that is if he if he hasn't seen it. So I think the like lier situation, hopefully we'll find out exactly what happened.",Ivan Perisic penalty decision Did referee get World Cup final call shockingly wrong  ESPN FC,04:58,00:00,TRUE
8,Unscripted Broadcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hviQNGi8RY,"We know who the real heavyweights are in the west, three titles in four years. How far away now are the Lakers from Golden State? 
They're two seasons. This season they'll make the playoffs. They should advance, and if they get another piece they should advance plenty. But they're not going to beat Golden State I don't think first year out. The following season, provided they get Kawhi Leonard, by hook or by crook, either by trade now or particularly in Stephen A's scenario, if they simply sign him and and retain their young, developing pieces, I think they beat Golden State the very next year. 
Guys, recall that Golden State, a 73 win team, but very much the kind of post-modern, ball handlers, also the scorers, Steph Curry spacing the floor, Draymond Green, the big plays five out, the prototypical post-modern team if you will, that still doesn't beat those dominant two-way wings. I brought it up in the last segment. 73 win team lost to a LeBron James Cleveland Cavaliers team and as great as Kyrie Irving is, he ain't Kawhi Leonard. 
You put Kawhi ... Kawhi is like a suped up Scottie Pippen in the sense that he plays defense just as well, but he's an even more efficient offensive player. You give LeBron James his Scottie Pippen, but that dude's bigger and better, or at least better, and you have more parts because eve -they didn't get Paul George but who's to say they won't wind up with Kemba Walker, or I mentioned Clint Capela, or someone else really good or Bergie Cousins Ingram and Kuzmo one of those dudes develop into a real good player. 
I'm sorry, it took the Warriors adding that great two-way wing to that team to overcome LeBron. LeBron and Kawhi together will not be denied, and if they get Kawhi the Warriors have this year coming up, but not the following one. The Lakers will win that year, 2019. 
It's interesting because obviously I believe that the Warriors are going are the favorites to win it all next year again. I don't think anybody could beat them. But it's not as far off as you think. It's not beyond the pale that bought that the the Golden State Warriors could get knocked off next year. 
We got to remember we saw some vulnerability in the Golden State Warriors this past season. We saw uh injuries uh to Kevin Durant at one point, Klay Thompson at another, obviously Steph Curry. We saw that. We also saw uh teams figuring them out but just knowing that you really, really couldn't stop them because they were offensively explosive. But the run for their money that was given to them by the Houston Rockets, if Houston could push you to seven games, if they could blow you out a game or two in the series or what have you, who's to say that the Lakers can't? 
Particularly when you look at the Western conference and you look at Portland, Utah, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, Minnesota, etc, you've got these teams going on. The Lakers are right in the middle of all of that. The West is certainly a situation where you could beat up you could beat each other up and somehow, some way you can force someone to appear to be more vulnerable than they've ever been in the past. And so even though I'm going to give the Golden State Warriors the edge, and believe that again they should be the prohibitive favorite, and it's undeniable, what I'm not going to let go of is the possibility that they could get knocked off this upcoming year. 
We could talk about Kawhi, all right? But the reality of the situation is is that when you look at some of these other teams it might not be necessary. I wouldn't be surprised at all if I found the Los Angeles Lakers in a conference finals against the Golden State Warriors next year because I think the loss of Trevor Reason in Houston is going to be huge. Losing him, you lose a guy that can spot up and shoot, but he's also one of you lead defenders, and I think that you can't underestimate the significance of his loss. So it could get very, very interesting in the West. I'm going to give Golden State the edge. I'm not refuting anything that you're saying Max. I just don't think it's as simple as you try to make it out to be because I think a lot could happen
But 
with the warriors this upcoming season.
Max, before you jump in, I just want to add this to piggyback on your point Stephen A. I have Westgate Las Vegas, their odds here, they have the Warriors as the favorites obviously 10 to 11, then Celtics and Lakers tied for 7 to 2 followed by the Rockets. So I found that surprising. Surpri - they feel like they obviously have a shot to be well in the finals there as well. 
Well, I definitely think the Lakers -
Well I I 
and the Boston Celtics are on the same on the same level with looking up at Golden State. But Boston's right there. 
I think Boston is ahead of them right now. I think as I like Ingram and Kuzma a lot. I like Lonzo if he gets the shot is a real good player, other parts of his game is already are already very advanced for his age and his experience. But the Boston Celtics, guys, the starting five if they do nothing else, Kyrie, Hayward, Jalen Brown, Tatum, Al Horfored, it's ridiculous, and right now, the only reason we'd even consider the Lakers in the same you know uh level around the Boston Celtics ...

9,Scripted Broadcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-rCUH1zn1o,"For over a decade, on streets, and in bars, and in living rooms, from Rio to Reykjavik, and everywhere in between, the debate has raged. Lionel Messi, or Cristiano Ronaldo. Who is the greatest player in the world?
The truth is, we've never seen a rivalry like this. Not in football, not in any of our major sports. But that debate might soon be over, and it might end without Messi or Ronaldo getting the trophy they so glaringly lack, the World Cup.
To understand why it matters that two individuals haven't won a team trophy that's only up for grabs every 4 years, you have to know just how dominate Messi and Ronaldo have been.
The winner is, Cristiano Ronaldo.
From 2008 through 2017, the Ballon d'Or, basically the sports most valuable player award, has gone to either Ronaldo or Messi. Five for Ronaldo, five for Messi, none for anyone else. It's not just Ballon d'Or's for Messi and Ronaldo.
Messi is the all time leading scorer in La Liga, in the Spanish super cup, in El Clasico, he's Barcelona's all time leading scorer in goals in all competitions. In European competitions, in goals in a calendar year. He scored 613 overall, 100 in Champions League, 61 for Argentina, 48 in the Copa del Rey. In other words, he puts up numbers.
So does Ronaldo, who is the all time leader in Champions League goals, and Real Madrid's all time leader in La Liga goals. He scored 84 in the Premier League, 81 for Portugal, 653 goals overall. 
But it's not just about individual success for these two. Messi's teams have won 32 club trophies. Ronaldo's teams have won 27 club trophies, all of this makes the lack of a World Cup that much more striking. Sure, football is a team sport, it requires coaching, form, depth, and a healthy dose of timing and serendipity, but Messi and Ronaldo aren't from historically struggling football nations. So why haven't the two been able to lift soccer's most coveted prize?
Let's start with Ronaldo. It was 2006 in Germany, and 21 Ronaldo helped Portugal to an unbeaten record in Group D. After a red card filled 1-0 win over the Netherlands in the round of 16, Ronaldo had one of his finest World Cup moments. Slotting home the winning penalty, in a scoreless quarter final versus David Beckham's England. But Ronaldo and Portugal would go no further. The squad ran into Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henri, and France, who one 1-0 and reached what became an infamous final, versus Italy.
Sadly for Ronaldo that has been the peak of his World Cup career. In South Africa in 2010, Portugal managed just one victory, 7-0 versus North Korea. They finished second behind Brazil in Group G. Despite taking a 19 match unbeaten run into the knockout stage and a perfect defensive record in the World Cup, Portugal ran into their Iberian Peninsula rival Spain, and their golden generation. David Villa scored, Spain advanced, and won the whole thing, while Portugal, went back home - again.
2014 was even more disappointing, Portugal were stuck with another powerhouse in the group stage, this time eventual champion Germany, and they lost 4 - zip in the opening match verse diamond shove. Then it got worse. Facing the United States in the second match, Portugal had to settle for a last gasp 2-2 draw to keep their dreams of reaching the knockout stage alive for one more game. Then despite Ronaldo's 80th minute winner versus Ghana in the final match, Portugal couldn't overturn USA's goal difference advantage, 8 years after being reasonably close to the final, Portugal didn't even reach the knockouts.
Lionel Messi meanwhile has gone in a different direction. 2006, as a relatively unknown teenager, he emerged off the Argentine bench and gave a proper introduction to the footballing world, scoring a goal in their second group stage game against Serbia and Montenegro. Messi came on again, late, in Argentina's 2-1 extra time overtime win over Mexico in the round of 16, but stayed on the bench, as the Albiceleste were eliminated by Germany via penalties in the quarter finals. 
In 2010 Messi was a known quantity, and it was perhaps his most disappointing World Cup. Coached by the iconic Diego Maradona, Messi struggled to make a major impression in the build up. Even so the squad was perfect in group B, and hopes were high Messi would seize the moment in the knockout stage. He didn't. After a 3-1 round of 16 win against Mexico, Messi's group fell well short in the quarter finals, falling 4-0 again to Germany.
Then came 2014 in Brazil, the heartbreak. Led by Javier Mascherano, the Argentine defense was stout. Messi got back to scoring too, scoring the eventual winner in the 2-1 opener against Bosnia and Herzegovina.","Why Messi and Ronaldo haven't won the World Cup, and why 2018 is likely their last chance | ESPN FC",04:57,00:00,TRUE
10,Unscripted Broadcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43AlD13scgY,"Do you think Mr. LeBron James will be patient enough to wait?
Uh yeah, he'll be patient for a year. Not for two years. Two years, next year you'll see him get another big time free agent in there. And, I say this, Will, I'm sure you got a lot of opinions. I'm telling you what from what I say is from I know, because I talk to LeBron's camp. And, LeBron is one of the smartest players that we've ever seen play the game. So, when he looked at that Lakers roster, the appeal to him wasn't another star, wasn't a big name as in when he went to Miami. The appeal was cap space, something I can grow with, something we can make some trades, makes some movement with. But, there are a lot of options there that he did not have in Cleveland. So, LeBron, you're going to look at year one, and be patient. Now, year two, you got to roll. You got to take the first year to just kind of get the lay of the land.
What does patience mean?
Ooh.
How are you defining patience? What do you what do you mean he's going to be patient?
Year one, he's going to go out, he's going to get at what he has. He's going to feel it out. If they don't win a championship, you won't see LeBron James pulling out his hair. You won't see him waving the towel. You won't see him yelling and screaming at teammates. He's going to be patient. He's going to ride this out. And, he's going to assess the roster, well maybe not he assess the rocker - roster, but they'll assess the roster at the end of the day, and you won't come back and hear LeBron James saying, ""This is a failure. We messed up. We had mistakes."" 
I got you now. I'm so happy I made you define patience. I see the fear in your eyes. I wish the camera would take it right now, because you're faking a smile to cover it up. You're in trouble. You got got. That's it. 
Will LeBron James be patient for a year? First of all, let me just lay down a little runway. I like this move. I like that he went to LA. I like the biggest star on the biggest stage. I also like that he went to a young team that's about building, that he can he can revitalize. A cornerstone franchise of the NBA. I like that he didn't just go find the best basketball roster out there and join it to to win the quickest championship. I like everything about it.
But, don't sell me BS. Okay? That's my one line in the sand that I always draw. Don't sell me BS and tell me it's something, it's gold, here. Here's this, it's nice, it's gold. No, it's not. It's BS. He's not going to be patient. And, I don't care who you've talked to, to be quiet honest. One of the problems -
What are your expectations? Since you keep throwing it out, what are your expectations?
I'm going to tell you my expectations. It's going to require-
Hurry up.
-a little bit of patience on your behalf. I fear that LeBron's patience will be like yours, momentary. Here's the deal, give me one piece of evidence beyond you talking to LeBron, because there's a curious thing about people that talk to LeBron. They say things that LeBron agrees with. They say things that LeBron wants to be said. So, I don't disrupt or I I don't take away from you that you might have talked to Rich Paul or or LeBron James. And, I'm sure they're telling you the way they feel today. 
But, give me one time, Ryan, just one. You can have the entire arc of his career. You can go back year by year. And, you can show me where this patience has been illustrated in the past. Just give me the year, the team, when he said, ""You know what, I'm cool sitting back this year. And everything that goes on around me, I'll be cool with it. I won't pull my hair out. I won't have a February melodrama. I won't fire off a Tweet mid-February talking about, you know, I don't know, maybe some kind of Aesop's Fables of how teams should should uh compete."" He'll give us some cryptic Tweets, something will go down in February. He'll be unhappy. He will lose his patience.
Does that mean he's going to say, ""Spend all your cap money right now before the season starts?"" No. Does that mean he's going to say for so
So how's that not patience, then? How's that? If he's sitting here-
Because that's why I just asked you to define patience.
No. If he's sitting here saying, ""We don't need to start now, we got to have Kawhi. We got to have these guys. You got to make moves. We gotta - we gotta blow this thing up."" Everybody who signed is committed on a one year deal. You just said, he understands this is a rebuilding process. These are young players. You can't throw out the word young player, Will, and say he's not going to be patient in the very next breath. And, yes, no, he's not looking at a championship this year. LeBron James obviously knows that's not realistic. So, for you to say that he's not going to be patient? This is a lie. He would have went to Philadelphia. 
Let's - let's talk about this
He would have forced his way on to Boston, if you said he wasn't going to be patient. He went to LA for a year of patience, clearly.
Listen, I like the idea, in theory.
No you don't.
I like the long term build. I believe the things Rich Paul, LeBron James are telling you. I believe they believe it today. But, that doesn't mean I'm going to buy the idea that come February, January, and March, he's going to be patient. And, I have asked you a question which you have not answered.
What's your question?
Show me the point in history, you can have all the years of his career, where he's been patient with a team that is not winning up to his expectations. Give me the time, and I will listen, and you will win the debate. But, show me in the past where he's been patient.
This year's NBA Finals. He literally played in a year of chaos amongst chaos. We saw the blunder from J.R. Smith. And, obviously, there was frustration-
And, he was patient?
There was frustration in the locker room.
When was he patient?
We saw frustration on the floor. But, if you watch LeBron in the press conferences, he was cool, calm, collective.","Will Cain, Ryan Hollins debate whether LeBron James will be patient with Lakers | First Take | ESPN",04:56,00:00,TRUE

Okay.
Okay.
Three, take your pick, AD or KD. 
Okay. 
Which one do you want? Because it's one of those two and the other guys is four.
Okay. 
Practically seven feet, great two way players, both with all world offenses, and great defenders, especially AD. There's four guys I just named. And five, look, when push comes to shove, you're taking Steph or you're taking Harden. 
Steph Curry ... whatever credit you want to give James Harden for creating the right culture in Houston. And he has, good for him. Unbelievable job he has, that's a winning personality he has. Oh, and by personality, I just don't mean that he's a nice guy, which he is. He obviously has a charming personality. But then he's a leader in the right way. Even if Chris Paul is the emotional leader of that team, Harden created a culture that a guy like Chris Paul could fold right into. 
So so he - but who has a better culture than the Warriors? Steph Curry, the unselfish superstar. The off ball screens, the welcoming in of KD, the whole thing created a situation where KD even wanted to play there. The ball doesn't stick with Steph Curry, right? What superstar in basketball does stick with least? Actually Steph Curry. And ultimately, Harden hits a lot of shots and he's a good shooter, but he's a volume shooter who's a good shooter. Steph Curry is maybe the greatest shooter ever. He's just a better shooter. And shooting is actually both like the where a lot of both these guys value's wrapped up. 
I'm taking Steph over Harden. I've got Harden right after Steph, that's amazing. Sixth best in basketball. 
Here's my thing, I'm not gonna sit up there and tell you that you're off your rocker, because I can understand why you made all those selections. I can understand why anybody make all those selections. I'm going to take two of those names out of there, that'll put James Harden in the top five for the purposes of this discussion at this particular moment in time. 
Okay.
I'm gonna take Kawhi Leonard out of there. And I'm gonna take Steph Curry out of there. Now, I know that sounds sacrilegious coming from a basketball savant such as myself. They don't call me Stephan A Smith for nothing. But let me break down what I'm trying to get at you. I'm only talking about for the season, in the moment, at this particular moment in time. 
Obviously, I look at Steph, I consider him the greatest shooter we have ever seen. I will never deviate from that. I know how formidable Kawhi Leonard was, not this past season because he only played last nine games, but the year before. Okay, I get all of that. Do you know that Kawhi Leonard never averaged 20 points a game until two season ago? I mean, this is what we're talking about here. So we know what a stout defender he is, and we know what ability he has, but in terms of the go get it, want it factor, want it bad factor, Max Kellerman, I'm not sure that's always been the case with Kawhi Leonard. Matter of fact I take it back, I am sure. That has not always been the case with Kawhi Leonard. 
Now you're playing in the system offense, you have Tim Duncan there with Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker, I understand it. But never the less, I'm still looking at what you've done and how badly you wanted it, as opposed to just going along to get along and doing your job. I'm sorry, James Harden's more valuable than that. 
I'm looking at Steph Curry, the greatest shooter in the world. You talk about ball movement, Max Kellerman, you talk about how people have to change things around. Max Kellerman, I've got news for you, who led the league in assists last year? Not this past season, last season. When he was runner up for league MVP? That would be James Harden. Do you know that Steph Curry has a career average of 6.8 assists per game? He's the greatest shooter in the world, we know he can score, we know how big Tommy is, et cetera, et cetera. Steph Curry averaged 30 in 2015, 2016. This past season he averaged 26. We know how surreal Steph Curry is. 
But James Harden has never averaged less than 25 a game since he arrived in Houston after being a reserve at OKC. James Harden has averaged 30 the last two years. James Harden averaged 29 and 29 the last two seasons before averaging 30 this year. Do you also know that James Harden gets to the free throw line an average of 10 games, the last four years. The last four years and five of the last six years he gets to the free throw line. So we're talking about a cat that can shoot, we're talking about a cat that can dance on you, get to the hold, nobody can guard him one on one, he can get his shot in the paint whenever he wants, he's a south paw, he's a lefty.

Good morning fellas. 
Oh, you decided to wear blue like Ebony, huh?
We called each other.
I know.
Twinsies. 
That's okay.
We figured it out.
The both of you.
Beat you down, tried to go beat Ebony down and you down today.
You feelin' paranoid? You should.
Nah, nah.
How are ya?
We good.
Yeah, here we go. 
How you doin' Ebony?
I'm lovely this Monday morning. 
Had a great weekend, had a nice dinner.
Wonderful.
Yeah.
Wonderful.
What's wrong with you, Skip?
Alright folks, we're gonna this morning with LeBron James. Now he definitely knows how to make an entrance. LeBron LeBron showed up at Lakers summer league game yesterday to a standing ovation, then he sat court side wearing purple and gold Lakers shorts. He also hugged his new teammate, Brandon Ingram, and even chatted with Ty Lue after the game. Now, LeBron's new boss, Magic Johnson, was full of compliments for the king, calling him quote the greatest leader in sports. Huge, huge statement. Shannon Sharpe, do you agree with that?
LeBron James says I'm out here living my best life. I'm living my best life. I ain't worried about you suckers.
He's looking oddly skinny to me.
No he's not. Stop saying that.
I don't know why. Go ahead. Floor's yours.
I would have to agree with Magic, although leadership is something that's very, very hard to quantify and people, you fall into two camps maybe, if you like Jordan and Kobe's leadership style. Some people scared that they ride you, kick you in the butt. 
That's true.
Some guys pick you up, bring you along, says guys I'ma really need you today. I'ma get you, especially in basketball, I'm going to try and get you involved, but I'm going to take Magic Johnson at his word. Magic Johnson was one of the all time great leaders in pro sports history, obviously to become the entrepreneur and business man that he did, obviously he had to become a great leader outside of the realm of sports.
He did.
So, he knows what a great leader, both in basketball and in the business world would equate to. I think what makes LeBron such a great leader, Skip, is that, and I'm sure Tom Brady, you can throw his name into this hat, but what Bron, what separates Bron, I think, is that we knew what he was able to do for seven years in Cleveland. Then he takes his show on the road and goes to Miami and he's also a great leader there, goes to four straight finals, two final, wins two of them, two MVPs. Goes back to Cleveland, goes to four more finals, wins another title. So, we've seen it over the course of his body of work over fifteen years, him being a great leader in a lot of different locations. 
We have yet to see what type of leader Tom Brady would be, Skip, if he is not in New England, if he doesn't have Coach Belichick. I think you have to weigh those into the mix because we've only seen him at one locale. We've only seen him with one head coach, basically with one owner, where LeBron James has moved around, and granted that's by his own fruition, but you look at what he's been able to accomplish and then you look at some of the teams that he's been able to take places that I do not believe and a lot of other people do not believe, they could have gone without him. It's hard to disagree with what Magic said. Again, leadership is something really, really hard to quantify but guys, and people that are great leaders, normally know what another great leader looks like and if Magic Johnson says this, I'm willing to take Magic at his word.
Hmm, so, this is a very difficult question for me because you know how much I love me some Magic Johnson. My love for Magic is just barely second to my love for Michael Jordan and yet to me Magic was an even greater leader than Michael was. He wasn't a greater player, but he was a greater leader and leadership was part and parcel of Magic's greatness. 
Right.
You can say he had all these hall of famers around, I'm not sure how great, great that team would have been without him being the driving force, the unifier, the igniter. It was showtime because it was winnin' time because of that guy, Magic Johnson.
Okay.
So, this is difficult for me because in basketball, if we just keep it right in basketball, he's the greatest leader ever. He's your Ray Lewis.
Right.

15,Phone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vDCm1PYkU0,"Alright, well lets get this thing started. Hello everybody, whoever's on the call, pleasure to talk to ya and we welcome you to our conference call here today. The goal of this conference call is to update shareholders and investors on where we're going as a company and talk about the new era of Nyxio and many of the things that are very exciting to come. 
Before we start I'd like to introduce our team. First of all I'd like to introduce you to Howard Bloomberg who is the chief operating officer for Nyxio. And I'd like to introduce you to Mirjam Metcalf. Mirjam is the chief financial control officer for Nyxio. I would like to introduce you to John Acunto. John was the ceo and President of 212, he is now the chief technology officer of Nyxio. Mark Gustafson is the chief financial officer for Nyxio. Lorien Sekora is on the phone as well she's the vp of marketing. Reese is head of social media and Cynthia Kaysar has come on as our chief strategy officer. Have I missed anybody?
Nope
Alright, perfect. So lets get this thing started. We're really excited about where we are today. One of the best things that has happened to this company in quite sometime is the fact that we just acquired 212, which I'm sure the majority of shareholders are very very excited about and so are we. What this does is it creates a brand new opportunity for Nyxio one, to expand on its ability to one, procure revenue and also it opens up new opportunities for some software which is where we started in regards for our expansion. 
Today you'll be able to see our product Vioware which is the user interface we're gonna show you today. Which is what we were allowing people to know about and also to show that we're moving in a different direction. A lot ... we released press on that and we wanted people to know that its absolutely brand new and essentially this product is what we call disruptive. It changes the way people interact with technology. So that is something that we will be talking about today and how we plan to use it, why we developed it, and we will be talking about some other software development as well.
So lets talk about the future of the company. Nyxio's new platform is, I don't want to say its new, our platform has always been conversions but we're moving just in a different direction and we are doing conversions with software now. So when we show you some of the things that we're doing I think you'll have a better understanding of why we're doing what we're doing and why we're calling this a brand new era. 
So a couple of things that have been new in the company, we've got a lot of brand new investors. We have brand new shareholders in the company via 212 and these opportunities also present us with some new things we never had before. With the fact that 212 had 17 million, 18 million invested in that company. And, along with that came a number of very high end investors. This opened the door for Nyxio to capitalize on these things and present ourselves to the market as a new company. The future of our company is primarily software.
Granted we do have wonderful hardware, everybody knows that we've presented the best tv in the market. We have shown that we're first in the market literally with everything that we've done. Our VioSphere product is now selling. We have a brand new manufacturer associated with that. We'll continue to bring up new hardware, its not that we're setting aside our hardware. Its that we're adding more things in our hardware category as we move forward with our software. On the software side, we're going down two different paths. One we're offering the software that we've been working on that is an operating system behind Nyxio's brand new user interface which is called Vioware. That's V I O W A R E. Along with that, we'll be developing apps which we'll talk a little bit about more and a couple of other things I think are going to be very very exciting. Lets talk about the acquisition of 212. 
212's Play Gig - It product we're not gonna ... we're gonna be showing you a little bit of that later. And the Rock This is first in the market in regards to social media and music. Its an amazing product and there are a number of reasons why we call it amazing but I want you to keep one thing in mind when we're talking about Nyxio as a company.",10 29 2014 Shareholder Conference Call Recording,04:56,00:00,TRUE

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Thank you, Nancy, and to everyone joining us, welcome. We're proud to announce the results of a very successful quarter today, setting new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings. We generated $61.1 billion of revenue. That's up 16% from last year, making it our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with iPhone revenue up 14%, services up 31%, and wearables up almost 50%. 
We grew in each of our geographic segments and in greater China and Japan, revenue was up more than 20%. iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half with 100 billion dollars in iPhone revenue, an increase of 12 billion dollars over last year, setting a new first half record, and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years. 
iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market, and customers chose iPhone 10 more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, this is the first cycle in which the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. Q2 was our best quarter ever for services, and momentum there continues to be incredibly strong. 
Revenue topped $9 billion for the first time, up more than $2 billion over last year's March quarter. We had all time record revenue from the app store, from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge, active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers. 
Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 100 million from a year ago, and up 30 million in the last 90 days alone, contributing to the overall increase in services revenue. Apple Pay continues its strong growth, with active users more than doubling, and transactions tripling year over year. We believe the availability of Apple Pay at major transit systems have been a key driver of adoption among commuters, and in March, we launched Express Transit with Apple Pay in Beijing and Shanghai, the 2nd and 3rd largest transit systems in the world. Apple Pay is already the most successful mobile transit payment system in Tokyo, which has the busiest transit system of all.
With the launch of Brazil in April, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets, and we expect Norway, Poland and Ukraine to launch in the next several months. This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPods with combined revenue of almost 50% year over year. Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company.",2018 Q2 Apple Earnings Call & Q&A (Conference Call Webcast),04:57,,FALSE
18,Meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW5Zsl5g5Lk,"Jan, I'll have you kick off the first question. What is your short list, and this is written, the question was written from perspective of project leader, but as a team member, shortlist of task, key task, that you'd like to accomplish in your first meeting with your act team. And most of you will have your first meeting with your act team today, so we thought this would be a highly relevant question.
So I think there are three parts to that three key tasks. And one ... If you look at page seven, six and seven of your act volunteer handbook, I put a little square around Team Kickoff Meeting, which is step number 12 or 13 for a project by the time our team kicks off in bio-design.
A lot of things will have happened already. There would have been conversations internally, conversations with a client, a plan, a draft plan developed, and my first recommendation would be is get everyone up to speed on everything that's happened to date. I have been on a project where it was sort of, yeah I talked to the board member and he said that's what we wanted and that's what we're going to do. It's sort of like the train has already left the station and you're running to get on it. I encourage team leaders to walk through everything that... You know. The piece of paper, that April 1st got that the client sent in to every conversation that's happened. An org chart would be great.
Here's who I've talked to at the organization, here's what their position is, here's what they said. Our bio-design team even has a better way of doing this. Dave Plow is leading it. The client is coming to our first kick-off meeting. He's going to be there for 30 minutes talking about the organization, why there's a project at all, and then he's leaving and we're having our meeting. 
Getting everyone up to speed is the first thing I'd recommend. At the tail of the meeting, I think, is also a sort of an easy thing... That's pretty easy to understand. The tail of the meeting is also pretty easy to understand, and I'll talk about the middle last. The tail is sort of what we all did at MBA school which is, you know, there's a team, there's a sub-team, there's a sub-team, there's a sub-team. Ideally it's two on a sub-team, or three so that if one drops off you still have someone, and there's also pairing of someone who's really skilled in that area and someone who is leaning a particular thing that they might not know as much about.
One small point on this one, I'm sort of a data wonk on teams, is that I like there to be sort of a data plan in place and talked about at the early days because it's often the hardest thing to get. One project that I was one for the YMCA, we wanted payroll data. That didn't come until four weeks before the end of the project and we finally had something to say, oh, this is okay now, now we know that your turnover rates aren't too high. So, I think that's generally true in consulting, is that the data takes a while.
That's the front and the back. The middle is... I think it would be helpful for our team leaders to walk through the the work plan and talk about, well, let me back up. I would want to know, joining as a team leader, sort of, take me through all the elements of the organization that you know about. What's the mission, what are they trying to do, how are they financed? Whatever the team leader thought about in advance in coming up with the work plan, what the client asked for, clearly. 
And then to go through, here's what my thinking is on the work plan and why I think it's this kind of problem, this is a funding problem or, for bio-design, I'll give two examples. For bio-design, what I have read, and I've only read the summary and what was marketed for volunteers, is that they've sort of accomplished their mission and they're looking for what to do next. Well that could mean either, that they don't know what to do next, or they don't know where the money is going to come from for what they're going to do next. Or there's no demand in the university for what they're doing, or it could mean a lot of different things, and I'd want the team leader to explain exactly the underlying reason that we're working on that thing. 
That's the beginning, middle, end.
I would just add that I think it's worthwhile, very early in your effort, to sit down and spend time together. Understanding what you know collectively, and what you don't know because you have an academic expertise, may have been your concentration of course work. You have the expertise and what you do for a living, but then there's a whole other thing which is real world experience, which turns out to be pretty valuable. 
Unless you understand where your holes are as well as where your strengths are, you may duplicate efforts or end up not having the expertise that you need in a project.
I have to add something to that- sometimes just ",Best Practices: First Team Meeting,05:00,00:00,TRUE
19,Meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmA2s9gXtvE,"So, let's go around the table and just have a high-level snapshot for my benefit and everyone else's, where the major sub-systems are. James, main control?
Well we've been working on the order flip flops for a number of weeks and have ended up with a list of requirements which they need to conform to. 
These are the Fasching units?
Yes. We've been liaising with John. The Fasching units ... The monostables are complicated in their behavior. But Tom and Simon have done in depth studies, and they feel confident that they can be made to work, and give us all the behaviors that we need. There's an issue with noisy signals from exact leaking through AND gates for the SEP signal, and those have to be cleaned up. 
Then there's an issue with how long you have to wait until you can set the flip flop again, after a reset. But we're talking with John in detail about the exact requirement there. It seems that we do have a period of grace during which John is seeking the next order.  And there's there's a minimum ... at least two monocycles there. And it could be a lot longer because it it it depends where the order is in the tank. But the minimum is two. 
On the next iteration around, we can bore you off as long as you want with the details of this stuff. 
We have a list of 11 requirements which I think define what's needed, and then Tom and Simon will produce electronics that meet that. 
Okay, so we'll have a drill down on that once we've done table.
We could do 10, but ... in fact we could do 11, but not all of them simultaneously. We could do 10, but there's one missing. 
However, there's a kind of broader, deeper question. The monostables are not easy to work with. Their behavior is a bit cranky. Tom says ""No"". And then, I did a survey of the historical diagrams that were found, and by 1952, quite a number of the flip flops on those collection of diagrams that we have ... and we don't know that that is a representative sample. We don't know what kind of sample it is. The great majority of flip flops had been changed to bistables. We don't know that they were monostables to begin with, but certainly by 1952, they're shown as bistables. Now, whether that's because they felt those were more reliable or easier to work with, I don't know. So there is that kind of question.
If we continue to have difficulties with monostables, there is that possible option of changing them to bistables, but the bistable that's in the documentation, the historical diagrams, does rely on a minus 200 volt rail to bias the grids. That's to force one of the valves off, strongly. Tom and I have produced a bistable for the operator control unit, which doesn't need the minus 200 volt rail. It achieves the biasing by raising the cathode, with a bias, so that there is a relative grid to cathode bias, to force one of the valves off. 
Anyway, that long ramble ... The question is if we were to continue having difficulties with monostables, and we might not, it may raise the question of rethinking some at least of the monostables. 
Okay, so let's put that on the agenda for deeper discussion on we've gone around the table. Okay, thanks James. John, anything from coincidence-
Well, the coincidence unit is probably working, so I don't concern. It's sitting there waiting to be used destibulative from the main control.

21,Phone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jC8KUwa-P0,"So this actually came from Amanda. So she texted me this week and she had questions basically at all the questions that we all go. And one that really stood out to me that have kind of been, people have been talking to me about. I don't know, it all feels like a theme right now.
But basically how to get over the fear... how to get over the fear of not wanting to be salesy or just not wanting to be that person when you're just starting out. And I wrote down a couple of things because looking back... we're all at different stages and that's really awesome. That's why we partner and we go in this together; because some people grow at different rates, and some people are at different stages of their lives, and some people have kids and are doing a little thing, and that's the best because we can all bring a different perspective into our businesses.
So I just have five points here because it's really straight forward and the moment that you can kinda get out of your own way and get out of your head; and start really feeling into your business and being the confident person that you are. That's when things start rolling a little bit quicker for you and you're not just spinning your wheels hoping and using hope to get anywhere. Because hope is not a game plan.
You can love your oils. As you're starting out, you can love your oils and be super passionate about the idea of building this business; but if you aren't stepping daily into fear and sharing your heart daily, you really aren't doing this as business. So my first point is taking your fear. That's all you have to do.
Fear is boring. We hear leaders talk about how boring fear is all the time and how when you step into your fear and through fear, that's when you connect with your freedom on the other side. So the whole point of this, when you're first starting out, and when you come up into a situation with an aunt or with your close friends or family; know that your family are the last people you go for it.

And then who knows what will happen from there? Maybe she'll be like, ""Thanks so much."" And then that's it. Or maybe you can use that as stepping stone and take it one step further, but if you never say, ""Hey, I like your boots,"" and move through that first layer of fear, you're never gonna connect with anyone, and this business is about connecting.",Zoom Call Recording,05:05,00:05,TRUE

""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Adventure One: A Scandal in Bohemia. 
To Sherlock Holmes, she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes, she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover, he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer, excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions, but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor, which might throw a doubt upon all his mettle results. Grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high-power lens would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.
And yet, there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. 
I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness and the home-centered interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment was sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. 
From time to time, I heard some vague account of his doings, of his summons to Odessa and the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the Daily Press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. 
One night, it was on the 20th of March, 1888, I was returning from a journey to a patient, for I had now returned to civil practice, when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. 
His rooms were brilliantly lit and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. 
I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formally been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was. But he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.

The edges, fringed with coral, disappear into the depths.
The reef is a jeweled city perched on the cliff top. It's a community with amazing relationships between animals, 5 centimeter wrasse-groomed sweetlips even combing the tender gills. They eat any parasites and dead skin, a reward for their trouble.

The Art of War by Sun Tzu. Translated by Lionel Giles. 
Part 1 Laying Plans
Sun Tzu said, The art of war is of vital importance to the State. 
It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence, it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected. 
The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. 
These are One: The Moral Law; Two: Heaven; Three: Earth; Four: The Commander; Five: Method and discipline.
The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.
Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.
The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.
By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.
These five heads should be familiar to every general. He who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.
Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this is wise.
one Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?
two Which of the two generals has most ability? 
three With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? 
four On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
five Which army is stronger? 
six On which side are officers and men more highly trained? 
seven In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?
By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.
The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer: let such a one be retained in command. The general that hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat: let such a one be dismissed.
While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.
According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.
All warfare is based on deception.
Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. 
If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.
If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.
Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected. 
These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.
Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all. It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.
End of Part 1.
Part 2 Waging War
Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a 1000 swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a 100000 mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a 1000 li, the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach the total of a 1000 ounces of silver per day.",The Art of War by Sun Tzu Full Audiobook Female Narrator,05:08,,FALSE
25,Scripted Broadcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5e7cl19Ha0,"The year is 15 CE and the Roman Empire is prospering. Most of the credit will go to the Emperor, but this success wouldn't have been possible without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix. Servius enlisted as a legionary eight years ago at age 18, the son of a poor farmer with few prospects. Unlike the majority of legionaries, he doesn't gamble, so he's been able to save most of his wages. He's even kept his viaticum, the three gold coins he received when he enlisted.
If he survives until retirement, he'll receive several acres of land and he's grown rather fond of a girl back home, whom he intends to marry. But he'll have to wait until he completes his 25 years of service before that can happen and the life of a legionary is dangerous and grueling. Today, Servius' legion, along with three others, has undertaken a great march of 30,000 Roman paces, the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers.
Servius' armor and weapons, including his gladius, scutum, and two pila weigh over 20 kg. And that's not counting his backpack or sarcina, which contains food and all the tools he needs to help build the camp: spade, saw, pickaxe and basket. Although Servius is exhausted, he won't sleep much tonight. He's been assigned the first watch, which means looking after the baggage animals and keeping alert against a possible ambush.
After he's done, he lies awake, dreading the day ahead, which will force him to recall his worst nightmare. At dawn, Servius eats breakfast with his seven tent companions. They're like a family, all bearing scars from the battles they fought together. Servius is from Italia, but his fellow soldiers hail from all over the Empire, which stretches from Syria to Spain. So they're all far from home in the northern land of Germania.
Servius' legion and three others with him today are under the command of Emperor Tiberius' nephew, Germanicus, named for his father's military successes against the Germanic tribes. Each legion has close to 5,000 men divided into cohorts of about 500, further subdivided into centuries of around 80 to 100 men. Each century is commanded by a centurion. An aquilifer or eagle-bearer marches at the head of each legion carrying its eagle standard.
The centurions march beside the legionaries, belting out orders, dex, sin, dex, sin, right, left, right, left, starting with the right foot, as the left is considered unlucky or sinister. Despite the strict discipline, there's tension in the air. Last year some legions in the area revolted, demanding better pay and a cut in the length of service. Only their general's charisma and negotiating skills prevented wholesale mutiny.
Today is a just march, only 30 kilometers. As the marshes and forests of Germania lie beyond the Empire's road system, the men must build causeways and bridges to make headway, something they've recently spent more time doing than fighting. Finally, they arrive at their destination, a place Servius knows too well. It's a clearing on the outskirts of the Teutoburg Forest, where six years ago, during the reign of the Emperor Augustus, Germanic tribes under their chieftain Arminius ambushed and destroyed three legions.
Proceeding along a narrow path, the legions were attacked from forest cover under torrential rain with their escape blocked. It was one of the worst defeats the Romans ever suffered and Augustus never lived it down. 
Servius was one of the few survivors. Servius still has nightmares of his comrades lying where they fell. But now, the army is back to bury the dead with full military honors.
As he helps in the task, he can't help wondering whether the bones he handles belongs to someone he knew. Several times he wants to weep aloud, but he pushes on with the task. The glory of the Empire can go to the crows. All he craves is to retire on a small farm with his wife-to-be, if the gods should spare his life for 17 more years.

26,Scripted Broadcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O0cz6y-pjo,"If you're like me, you probably have a smartphone in your pocket. It's easy to forget how incredible it is that one little device can do so many things, like taking pictures. At one point, you needed a special camera loaded with light-sensitive film to take a photo. And if you didn't know what you were doing, all of your pictures would be ruined. But nowadays, you can take hundreds of selfies with just the tap of your finger. The digital camera inside your phone is doing the heavy lifting, thanks to some feats of electrical engineering.
Digital cameras don't see images the way we do. To them, a picture is just a series of ones and zeroes. So when you take a selfie, the first thing your phone has to do is change light into electronic data that it can understand. Light comes in packets of energy called photons. And to generate an image, a digital camera needs to figure out how many photons are reflecting off your face and coming through the lens and how much energy those photons have.
To do that, digital cameras usually have an image sensor called a complementary metal oxide semiconductor, also known as a CMOS sensor. There's a good chance that this is what's in your phone camera, or in a DSLR. A CMOS sensor is mostly made up of layers of silicon, which is a semiconductor. Semiconductors let you control electrical conductivity or how easily electrons can move through a material. They're usually materials with chemical impurities mixed in, so they don't conduct electricity as well as metals, but they're more conductive than an insulator like plastic.
The CMOS sensor in your phone is made up of a grid of picture elements known as pixels. When you take a selfie, a photon reflects off your face, flies into the camera, and hits a pixel in the CMOS sensor. When the photon hits a silicon atom in a pixel, the atom absorbs the photon's energy, and its electrons become excited. And if the photon transfers enough energy, one of those excited electrons will get spit out. This creates a charge in that particular pixel, which the camera measures and interprets as brightness. The more photons that hit a pixel, the stronger the charge and the brighter that pixel gets.
Now, on their own, all these pixels can detect is brightness. Any picture they would take would be black and white. Adding color means there's another piece to this technology puzzle. Like paint, light has three primary colors, in this case, red, green, and blue. By mixing them together in different amounts, you can create any other visible color.
So to make a color photo, a digital camera has to measure how much red, green, and blue light is hitting the sensor at each pixel rather than measuring all photons that are hitting each pixel. There are a couple of ways to do this, but one common system, called the Bayer array, involves layering colored filters over groups of four pixels, one red, one blue, and two green. The array uses two green pixels because our eyes are especially sensitive to green wavelengths of light. 
With a Bayer array, each pixel can absorb energy from one of the three primary colors of light and become charged. Once the sensor has measured the charges created at each pixel, the camera has to interpret all that color and brightness information to generate an image. 
There's a lot that goes into this, but one important step is called de-mosaicing. Basically, the camera needs to blend the primary colors together. Otherwise, every pixel would be either pure red, green, or blue. De-mosaicing involves some guesswork, like how much blue light would have hit a nearby green pixel. Engineers and mathematicians have several methods to calculate this, but most involve algorithms that can compare nearby pixels to each other and average out their values.
Thanks to this process and some more computing power, your phone will display a picture on its screen. But if there's something you want to do with it, like say, post it to Instagram, there's often one more step. The image file needs to be compressed. 
See, digital cameras collect a lot of data very quickly, and if you want to send your picture over the internet, you usually want to make it smaller. 
There are lots of different algorithms for compressing images, but the one you'll see most often on the web was developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group, or JPEG. JPEG compression divides the pictures up into eight by eight blocks of pixels and simplifies the information needed to describe them. 
Compression isn't always perfect. Larger blocks can lose too much detail and make the image pixelated, while smaller blocks will preserve more information, but the file size will still be pretty big. But to social media sites which have to pay to store all those selfies you post, small files are more important. 
Thanks to a lot of technology working together, in less than a second, your phone can turn light energy into a digital signal, piece that signal together, and compress it into a neat little package, a picture you can share with the world.

27,Meeting,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeYrfFumV8k,"Okay, well hello guys. Welcome to our first recorded meeting. So I guess we can talk about the organization that we are going to be working with. 
Um, which is ALPHA.
Yeah...
Association of Latino Professional in Accounting and Finance. Well, Finance and Accounting. And basically the problem is is that like they have a committee of member relations that like recruits people, like that committee is no longer, they don't have that committee anymore, because last semester the committee like... the deputy basically like the runner of the committee was lacking, so like his leadership skills were lacking, so that caused like everyone in the committee to just like you know not be committed, so now they don't have a committee so they have a lot of trouble recruiting members. So all their members in ALPHA are existing members. They don't have any newcomers or anything.
And that's like they used to be a large organization, but that's causing them to like not  be ...they don't have anyone to recruit. And that's obviously a problem in the long run, you know?
Yeah.
If you don't have anyone to recruit. 
When you went -
so basically, since I'm a member of ALPHA, I went to their... they invited me to their committee and I observed some of their problems and I took like notes. So basically, um one of the problems was that they weren't... they were focused on events that were only in the business school, like all their events were only held in the business school. I understand they're like a business school committee, but like they should be more diverse. For example, some freshmen don't even have courses in the business school. My first semester, I didn't - I never came to the business school. I feel like their problem is that they need to maybe have like their bake sales in Robeson or like some of their events, or even advertise. They don't advertise in Robeson. Their - all their advertisement is only in the business school.
And because the business school is like so far off-campus anyway, like sometimes people don't want to travel all the way over here just to attend a meeting. So yeah, definitely it would be really good for them to be in the center of campus. That way they're more easily accessible.
And I feel like one of the other problems that I observed was... where was it? Um they don't really target like freshmen and sophomores. Like they, they told me about their events, and like I read some of their fliers, and like it was only targeted towards the juniors and the seniors. I feel like some freshmen... they like they need to get going on their career earlier, so that could be... because I'm actually the only freshman on ALPHA. They don't target like freshmen. Especially like as a sophomore, like you need to start your internships sophomore year.
Do they provide like career experience? Or do they only focus on... like when you have these meetings, what do - like what do they talk about on a daily...
Well like, in our meeting, they talk about like um, they said they have a lot of information sessions. But I'm like, you know, like information sessions are fun like the first two times, but they don't - they're lacking like events. Like you know, like I'm a part of this other organization called NABA, and they have like leadership skills events or conventions or this and that. Like ALPHA only focuses on counselling information sessions. They're called Accounting and Finance Society, but they don't have any... they don't target finance companies, so that's what bothers me. Someone who's a finance major might not get anything out of ALPHA, so maybe that's why they're lacking members.
And also their meetings are about like three hours long. So if you're not committed, that's a problem. I feel like they should try to cut their meetings shorter.
How wait - how frequent are they having meetings?
About like every two weeks? On a Friday night.
Oh, so that's another problem right there. 
From - on a Friday night from about like 6:30 to 9 p.m. 
Oh, yeah. Maybe we can...
That's like a really big problem. Because I didn't even feel like sitting through the meeting. So you know, someone who's not 100% committing is not going to want to dedicate 2 and a half hours every other week.
And also, people are commuters as well, so...
Yeah, on a Friday night?
That might not even work because of other obligations, so it's kind of like just trying to meet everybody in the middle. 
Yeah. So those are just like... I did write like a long list, but, I guess throughout the semester we could target everybody, you know? I feel their major problems are um, their events are a little lacking because they only have information sessions, and they're lacking like who they target. They only target accounting majors and not like a broad spectrum like all business majors. They're not targeting all class levels.
Does it come from a lack of money...?
No, it's just they don't have a committee to like do, you know, like do the information sessions, to recruit. Like they're lacking that.
They need motivated people who want to get the word out, but there's not that many people.",Group 1 Recorded Meeting,04:50,00:04,TRUE

As a Budget Council chair, I couldn't have asked for a greater team. Please have a seat. 
They worked hard. They were dedicated. The task that was given to us was difficult and they put everything they had into that task. On behalf of the Budget Council, I want to start out by thanking President Caboni for giving us the opportunity to work on the budget stabilization plan. The Budget - Budget Council has existed in its current form as an informal advisory group to the President for the last five to six years. Last Fall, when President Caboni arrived here, he redefined the charge and reconstituted the council. Um, he gave us broad latitude to come up with a comprehensive and detailed plan to not only address immediate shortfall of 15 million, but also to come up with a long term look forward we so that we could do well, so that we could succeed as an organization. The President needs to be applauded for taking a creative and strategic, and innovate approach. He sought creativity and he specifically asked all of us to think about what's good for the institution. Not necessarily what's good for our own areas of affiliation. 
The most pertinent cost drivers for us, were the enrollment trends in each college and the bottom line fact, that WKU today is a smaller institution than we were a few years ago. Both in terms of the number of students we have on campus, as well as the number of faculty and staff. We were tasked to do a difficult job, manage a cut. We were very deliberate in our decision making. But we often revisited each decision. Sometimes in more than - sometimes more than once. The reason for that was very simple. We wanted to be able to provide a rationale for what we were doing and why we were doing that. Um, from the financial standpoint, we recognized that our task was critical to the success of this organization that we all love. However, we never lost sight of the fact that at the end of the day, there are people who are going to be impacted by the recommendations that we're going to make. And the way we approached this, or at least one way in which we approached this is by taking a serious look at the weaker positions.
Last Fall, President Caboni instituted a personnel action process, that basically forced all of us, especially that committee, to ask the difficult questions before hiring an additional employee; can we still do our job of educating our students and addressing their safety and security, and the well-being of our employees without hiring that person? And if we could, then the answer was we should not go ahead and hire a new person under the current circumstance.

It's good that that you found a place to eat now, that you're all set for lunch.
Uh, breakfast technically.
Breakfast? 
uh huh.
Its 25 til 11?
When you go camping and you have no food packed with you the first meal still counts as breakfast I think.
I'm surprised because you used to keep food from each meal so that you had a little a little food when you were on your own.
Food stashed away? 
Mhmm.
Yeah, that would be smart planning.
What's uh, what's the weather like? You are in Croatia right now?
We're in delightful sun right now and I'm so happy about that.
Was it the same the last few days?
I guess
Yesterday was mixed sun and clouds, before that was pretty much all cloud. And it - it changes the pace of everything, but it still brings your moods and spirits when there's sun, and you're on a solar bicycle. And uh, and every time you stop for a bit, your battery comes back more charged. yeah. It's a nice feeling.
Cool cool. Well, especially since you have quite a - a heavy bike all together. I noticed this morning, I saw your story on the group wechat we have about the free wheel that you got a repair last night. Can you tell us more about this?
Yeah we've had an unbelievable experience in Croatia. One of the mechanical things on our bike that I was kind of most nervous about from the beginning was the free wheel that links the rowing system to the pedaling system. Because it's always going backwards, forwards, backwards, forwards and that's a pretty harsh thing to deal with mechanically. So when we built the - the unit before I left I always planned to have a backup piece with me but it was working good enough it wasn't top priority. And then as you know on our initial trip to um to Chamonix, we had that free wheel that was built in, fail, but Guillone  had enough tools to be able to remove the broken part inside, continue using it and I have my team in Vancouver, uh, they're going to be preparing a replacement for us. But obviously that didn't get built and shipped to us in time, and then yesterday it finally happened where the free wheel we were using stopped working. 
And uh, and then we searched on Google, we're in just the tiniest little towns in Croatia right now, pretty near the border with Serbia. Lots and lots of abandoned houses, no big commercial centers. And so searched bicycle repair, found a thing on on Google that was about 30 kilometers away and we had enough battery just to motor there without human power. And we get there and it's just a house. We're like, ""This can't be right. What's going on? It said it's a bicycle repair store.""
And then on the side of the house we see this tiny little sign that says Bicycleta something Repair. It was easy enough to understand. Um. So we knocked and had so little hope of anything. And an older man opens the door. And I had pre translated on my phone, ""Hey, we're touring from Canada. We have a bicycle problem. Uh, wondering if you can help us repair it."" 
And luckily enough he had enough English that he was able to talk and say, ""Oh no, not me but my son."" And then he takes out his cell phone, phones his son who was out celebrating, it's a National Day with uh - in Croatia. And 10 minutes later his son shows up, and sure enough, shows us to his backyard garage and it's just packed with various bicycle parts and tools. And he's been running a side business, he's the only person in town that services and fixes bicycles. 
And through miracle of good fortune he had just the pieces we need, including a single seat free wheel and all the machinery tools that disassemble and unscrew the old one. And uh, so while he was doing all that he insisted on me not helping. And his - his uh father told us all of his stories, you know, he's a multi generational Croatian, has been living in that little house all along. Yeah. It was just such a marvelous experience. They refused any kind of offers of of of payment for that, they were just very happy to help some travelers and yeah, share their little stories of life in Croatia.
Yeah. Well. It's amazing that you don't have to go very far to actually experience so much hospitality uh, when you're on -
No - 
- a long trip like that.
No, and that's been our experience all along. And I mentioned that part of why we've had such a difficulty, our goal has been to make 200 kilometers a day and we've only succeeded in that about half of the days. We keep not making it because - because of hospitality, we're running into people ",Phone call with... Justin (& Anne-Sophie),04:57,00:07,TRUE

Hello.
Howdy.
So uh, I'll be opening for you guys in Richmond on July 26th, at Capital Ale House.
 And uh, Looking forward to it. Think it's gonna be a really fun night. 
Can't wait ourselves.
Um, so I usually like to start off with something that I think everybody can relate to, which is uh, food on the road. 
Um, I remember when I met you guys it was uh, I was with Matt and we were down at South By and we hopped in y'all's van and actually went out to Nikki Lane's party. And I remember - remember you guys had that awesome like Yeti cooler in the van.
Hahaha.
Hell yeah.
Is that uh, is that a staple?
Yeah, it's a staple for us. We actually have a strict no food policy in it after a, uh, a notorious dairy and deli meat incident several years back.
Ha ha ha.
What happened?
You just start changing the ice and something falls in to that water and then it becomes food water and maybe the milk spills and you don't clean it quite fast enough.
It's terrible.
It was gnarly.
What was it, Taylor had milk for his tea that he was making and it exploded in there and it was - yeah, it was pretty bad.
We had to get whole milk that's like unpasteurized, like solid milk.
Mmm. Sounds good.
Oh man.
Yeah, what do you like to eat on the road?
I don't know, so - it's so hard. I'm trying not to eat fast food but, uh, Matt in particular, he's kind of obsessed with Bojangles.
Ooh, okay. What do ya'll
What's your favorite fast food spot? Do you have like a...
I mean probably, Chick-fil-A is included, you know, because that's kind of the best. But...
Wendy's is always a good deal.
Okay.
What about you guys?
Yeah.
We stop at Taco Bell a lot...
Ooh.
Yeah.
They have good -
Yeah?
They have good options for like vegetarians and stuff too I guess.
Yeah one of the few places that has that. John and Matt from our band kind of have a history there. It's sort of yeah, tradition.
And we - we eat vegetarian at Taco Bell, I will say that.
Cool.
We'll do - we get on those long tours and a few days at Taco Bell in a row. We're like aiming for a place that has a salad bar but, you know. Try to get those leafy greens pretty often, we try to be fairly healthy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah well I'm always envious of people that have, obviously a tour bus, mostly just for the kitchen though.
Yup.
We do -
Going after shows?
Are you tired of it yet?
I mean I don't know if our rider will be fulfilled at this show but are you  - are you pretty pro at smash and grab after the headliner leaves? Like, snag all the snacks from their green room? 
Yeah
That they left?
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Definitely. 
I'll even do that if I'm not even playing the show I'll just try and get in the green room.
Ha ha ha ha
We got to survive out here man.
What'd you say?
It's tough to survive out there, you got to take what you can get.
Definitely.
So you guys are going to be opening for Nikki Lane?
Yeah.
Yeah most of this month is all ... I guess we filled in a few spots, we're really happy to be able to play with you in Richmond man. It's going to be a good time but, pretty much everything else we do on that run is opening for Nikki Lane.
Awesome, have you guys played with her before?
Um.
Years ago.
Yeah.
One time in 2014 I think at South By. But uh, yeah, knowing the band and seeing her around for years. And then last weekend, yeah we played a couple shows and it was a really good time with those guys.

Hey, Dan.
Hey, how are you?
Good. How are you?
Not too bad. 
Um, so if it's cool with you, I'm going to record this.
Yeah, yeah. No problem. 
How's it going? Have you been happy with the release so far?
Yeah. Yeah, I think, I think well. I mean, I'm - I'm somewhat detached from it, but, uh, from what I hear, it's going well.
Awesome. So uh, one of the things that I've really, like, just really caught my ear first was the production. I'm like, there's a lot of things going on but it all sounds really good. Um, maybe do you mind just telling me a little bit about how you recorded it?
It was recorded on a eight track cassette uh, machine originally. Once I, once, you know, all the - all the the bed instruments and vocals, actually everything except the strings horns and piano which were done when we got back from Europe, were recorded on the the eight track. 
Awesome. Where did you record it? Or where did you record
Um -
 the eight track stuff?
The eight track stuff was done in Carlsbad, Sweden. I had, like, a month um just kind of layover between tours. So uh my friend, Roya, let us tape it in her cabin for a month and uh -
Awesome. 
Did you same the song -
She -
Is the song named after her? 
Yeah, yeah. And she sourced all the materials we were going to need, minus the tape machine. 
Cool. Is that your tape machine?
Well, we bought it uh, in uh Copenhagen. It was kind of a strange situation where we were looking for a very specific machine that was most likely going to be very hard to find and then in the end, uh the guy who was hosting our Airbnb had uh, had one for sale. 
That's awesome. 
Yeah.
That's, like, really fortuitous. 
Yeah, big time. 
Um, what kind of tape machine is it?
Um, I think it was a Yamaha. Let me ask Kenny 'cause I don't remember exactly. 
Hm.
Kenny, do you remember what that eight track was? It's Yamaha, right?
Yamaha ...
Oh, it's like the ... What is it, uh - MT, MT8. Yeah, that's right. 'Cause I used to use the mini disc version of the same thing.
Awesome.
Which was the MD8. Yeah.
I have a um, Tascam 388, a little quarter inch eight track. 
Oh, yeah. 
Yeah. I love - I love recording on tape. 
Yeah.
So um, you don't - Matt told me that you don't fly-
No. 
- but you tour in Europe. So you - you take a ship?
Yeah. 
That's pretty cool. 
Yeah,
Are you - 
It's alright. 
Are you going to be taking a ship over this fall when you guys tour over there? 
That's awesome. 
Does the um, does the whole band go on the ship or is it mostly just you -
No, it's usually, yeah, me and whoever else uh, wants to join.
How long does it take?
Uh, seven days. 
So do you do a lot of writing and stuff on the ship?
Yeah. I do whatever. I bring - I bring supplies to kill the boredom. 
Yeah. Well, that's cool. Um, so I really like the song Modern Pressure and I guess one question I have is did you - did you write the song first or did you have the um, album title first?
Um, I wrote the song first. 
Uh, what does modern pressure like mean - mean to you?
Um, I - I don't really know any more. It probably made sense at the time but I - I'm feel somewhat distanced from it now. 
Yeah
I mean I think it means something entirely different uh, than the -than the  whole - than the record in its entirety to me now. 
Mhmm.
But uh, at the time, uh, yeah, I can't exactly recall. 
So do you think that ...
That was kind of like, like sponged from Freeverse.
Right. Do you find that a lot of your songs kind of change meaning after they're kind of, like, out in the world and they have a life?

33,Phone,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCqaT61Yhzk,"Hi, everyone. This is Rebecca Soler. I'm the audio book narrator for the series, and I am so privileged and psyched to be speaking with Marissa Meyer.
Hi, everybody. I'm Marissa. I'm of course the author of Lunar Chronicles, and I'm very thrilled to be here as well.
Okay. So first things first, how do you feel to be you know completely finished with such a an amazing series?
Oh, it's been very bittersweet. On one hand, I'm very excited for the book to be out in the world. Um, I've kind of known how the series was going to end since the very beginning when I first started coming up with the story and the characters, so I'm really looking forward to being able to share the ending with readers and I hope they'll find it satisfactory and that they'll you know have loved going along on this ride with me. But, on the other hand, you know. I've been living with these characters for the last seven years of my life, and it's really sad to be kind of saying goodbye to them and sending them on their way. So it's it's a very bittersweet thing.
Personally I loved being able in this last book to really see Luna for the first time and see the people of Luna and and see how the disparity you know  in terms of how people were living, the citizens versus the aristocracy. I'm really glad that you made that change and had Scarlet kidnapped and brought to Luna.
Well, thank you. It was a lot of fun and it gave me ... you know, having - changing it so that Winter and the crew now ends up in one of the outer sectors, and I always thought we would end up in the outer sectors eventually anyway because that made the most sense for where the uprising would start. Um, but having that more personal connection and developing that uh friendship between Winter and Scarlet and both of them getting to see the outer sectors and and you k now Wolf's family and all of these other little things together um I felt had much bigger impact.
Your attention to detail and just the way that you would weave in just little little plot lines is just something as a reader and as a narrator I loved to discover. Like for example, learning that Wolf never had a tomato, not because of him being a wolf, but rather because in the outer sectors they they weren't um given access to fresh produce was so devastating and also such like a little nugget of exploration that like you got to find as a reader. It was a really cool detail.
Well, thank you. And I feel as a writer so often those little details um, kind of surprised me. It's one of those weird things of being a writer that you don't always feel like you're totally in control. You don't always feel like it's you writing the story. Um, you know sometimes I'll be writing along and a little detail will just you know come out of my fingers and onto the page. And I think, ""Oh, wow. So that explains so much. I had no idea."" And so I always feel like I'm discovering the world and the characters uh for the first time as long - as well as the reader.
Were there other fairytales that you explored potentially weaving in or were there any that you wished you had the opportunity to sort of explore or any that you would revisit in a different capacity?
Oh, sure. Tons. Um when I was first planning, I had a whole list of fairytales that I wanted to include. Um and the one that almost made it into the series was Puss in Boots.
Oh!
Um, yeah, Which is one of my favorite fairytales. And so originally I had planned for this to be a five-book series, and Puss in Boots was going to be the final in the series. But then as I was outlining and and  figuring out how all these stories fit together, it became pretty clear pretty quickly that it just didn't fit and wasn't working.
Um, so it didn't - Puss in Boots didn't last very long in the planning process, um but there was a time when I thought I was going to do a Puss in Boots book as well. Uh, but now I still love fairytales. I would love to someday do a Rumpelstiltskin retelling. Um, I would love to do a Bluebeard retelling at some point, uh, but I don't know that they will be sci-fi or Lunar Chronicles related or possibly something completely different. Or if I'll even ever do them at all. But those are definitely two fairytales that I see lots of potential for.
Oh, that's a really, really interesting.
I will say that we have a short story collection coming out called Stars Above in February, and there is an epilogue type story in that collection that will take place about two years after the end of Winter.

Thank you for joining me tonight, I'm really honored that you're able to call in, I know you have a very busy schedule but thank you once again.
My pleasure.
Now I know you have a tour coming up, it's a brand new tour 14 city tour and you start tonight in Shelton Washington, how excited are you to be out on the road again? And what motivated you starting this tour? 
Uh, we've been touring pretty steadily during spring and summer for the las uh t 7 or 8 years and and this is our usual start up time, and we usually go til uh, til til the end of October and we we usually cover about 40, 50 cities. So - so uh uh maybe what you see on uh on our tour right now is just the beginning of it. And we we tour pretty steadily we do mostly weekends now, and uh we we enjoy ourselves quite a bit.
That's great. Now can you tell us a little about the band that's going to be touring with you?
Yeah, um my brother Ben on drums, Andy Knoll on on the keyboards, AD Zimmer on bass and Michael Scarto on gui - on guitar. Those are all Rochester NY uh musicians except for my brother who lives in Manhattan, and uh, you know, it's good to play with home town boys and uh we have a lot of great players in Rochester.
Will your twins be joining you for this tour? I know they've joined you in the past for some encores a couple other tours back in the day.
Oh yeah,  uh this sum- this summer they will be out with us for for a couple weeks, they're going to be 15 this year. 
Wow.
So I think uh, this might be the last last time they want to tour with us, uh because their - their summers are filled up with sports and other stuff you know?
Right. Now what's your set list going to be like? Is it going to be a mix of Foreigner and your solo works?
Definitely will, yeah maybe with an old Beatles song thrown in there.
That's great, I'm actually honored to see you next Friday at the Levoy Theater here in Millville. I'm definitely going to check you out. And I'm really honored to have tickets to be able to go and see this legendary voice of the 80's.

That's great! Now I'm a fellow musician, so I have a question for you, how did you go about presenting new songs to the band when you were in Foreigner because your writing abilities were amazing and you came out with so many great hits. Did you just present lyrics to them or was it all collaborative effort?
It was - a lot of it was collaborative effort, and a lot of time Mic would present me with musical ideas and and and ask me to put put a put a lyric and a melody to it, and then there would be sometimes when uh for instance, Jukebox Hero I presented to him uh the the whole intro and the verse and and we collaborated on on the on the chorus. So so uh you know, it can work uh it can work a million different ways as long as you have that uh collaborative spirit and the willingness to give and take you know?
Yes, absolutely the chemistry was there for sure. Now speaking of one of your hits, ""I want to know what love is"" definitely is one of the greatest rock ballads basically people say it is. Did you know you had a classic on your hands when you wrote and completed the song?
Uh we we we were extra excited about it, and and  I don't know there there was this there was this buzz especially after after um, you know the chorus was on, the choir was on it and, and and it was mixed and it just listened to the mix and it just uh, it put chills in us you know? And and the the record company presidents uh came down and listened, and we were getting slapped on the back as if we had a hit already you know when when the reality is, nobody knows I it's going to be a hit or not. So so while we took their their their best wishes to heart we we still we still knew that it was anybody's guess whether it would catch on or not. And and fortunately we we scored a number 1 hit around the world. So you know?
Absolutely, and speaking of hits in 1976 you made your first album coming from Black Sheep to Foreigner, and how did it feel to have your first hit ""Feels Like The First Time"" going from a local band now to a world-wide known band almost, at the time with that big hit. How did it feel for you?
Well, it was fantastic! Mind you uh although although Black Sheep was was a Rochester band, we uh we had 2 albums uh on Capital Records and we were touring with the likes of 10 Years After and Kiss, you know?
Right. That's great.
In those years, that was that was big guns and and uh we did see the world and uh played a lot of shows with a with a lot of uh important headliners, so so I I kind of I kind of felt seasoned already.",May 2014 Exclusive Phone Interview: LOU GRAMM OF FOREIGNER,04:59,00:05,TRUE

Well, uh you know, there's a group of us that just throw out ideas and see if we can come up with something that makes sense that we think we can pull off that would be unexpected and uh you know fit into kind of the overall picture of what Gov't Mule is all about. Um, it takes a lot of work and we start preparing way in advanced, you know. But, it's worth it. Those shows end up being some of the highlights of the year.
Are you guys already thinking about what you might do on New Year's Eve this this year coming up?
Yeah, I mean, it's a little premature, but, we've started thinking about it. But, we haven't we haven't really come up with anything concrete yet.
Um, I'm just curious, you know, this past New Year's Eve, you had a a DJ on stage from a radio station, WCOS. Uh, was that Joey Arkenstat?
It was a guy named Steven Payne, who uh is an actor. And, we hired him to uh to be the DJ for the evening. He wasn't really a DJ and there really is no WCOS.

Many people are obviously familiar with your work with the Allman Brothers Band and Gov't Mule, but could you tell us briefly about um your involvement with Evil Team Records, Hard Head Management, and and the charitable organizations that you're involved with?
Well, uh let's start with Evil Team. Uh Evil Team is a label that was originally uh founded by my wide Stefanie Scamardo. And, then, a few years ago it it had kind of gone a little dormant, there was not a lot going on. And, we decided to kind of relaunch it. And, I got more involved with it at that point as a - an opportunity to put out music that we have in the can that doesn't necessarily qualify as a major label release. 
Starting with a lot of the charity stuff, like uh, the Christmas Jam show that I do in Asheville, North Carolina every year. This coming year is going to be the 20th anniversary.
Congratulations.
We put out two CDs which would be volume one and volume two of the benefit concert. We're about to put out, we're about to skip ahead to volume eight, which will be the first DVD, which is from two years ago with Dave Matthews, and Taj Mahal, and Branford Marsalis, and Gov't Mule, and Marty Stewart and the New Orleans Social Club, and uh John Popper Project, with DJ Logic. It was a wonderful show, and we put the highlights out. Um the the proceeds for all that stuff go to Habitat for Humanity. The ticket sales, the merchandise sales, the DVD sales, uh everything goes to Habitat. 
Um, Hard Head Management is my wife, Stefani's, company that she founded uh many, many years ago. When we first met, she was in the music business, and I was in the music business. But, at the time, we kind of agreed to not work together, which we kind of uh honored that agreement up until when Gov't Mule was founded in late '94 uh and, I had my own manager. And, Alan Woody and Matt Abts inherited my manager, so to speak.

Mike, thank you. I appreciate it, uh, the support. Hey, what can I say? I think it was just a total team effort, you know, entire 40 minutes. Um, I have to say, you know, our approach to the game, um, yeah, we were very, very, very focused, and had an an unbelievable shoot around today. Uh, everyone was locked in and just just just really, really focused and locked in on the things that we needed to do. And you know, anytime you're on the road, it's tough. I mean very, very difficult. 
Um, our guys came out and just really got after it. Um, you know, definitely Fresno, they're athletic, very similar to us and our program. A lot of like-sized players. Uh, they play multiple positions, so they had to get up and down. And they've got a lot of play makers, but our guys came out tonight and just locked in and um, you know, just really kind of took it to them. 
And just played a really smart basketball game. And you know you mentioned, you know earlier we we were uh 83% you know from the line, I think 26 and 31, which is very nice - there's something that we talked about as a team. We want to try to shoot right at about 75, you know eighties a bit of a stretch but we could be at 75% as a team. I think that can really help us win some basketball games. But just a total team effort, we did everything we needed to do to shoot a lot get the victory. 
We ended up having six guys in double figures, which helps. Uh. It helps a lot. So it balance, uh we need to do a little bit better job on the rebound. We're still a minor school team on the glass. We need to do a better job rebounding the ball and and I think we'll do that. But we can only get better. This is only one game. But definitely something big for our guys and very great for their morale. 
Very good. And you said it's only one game, but what a difference a game like this can make for going down the road in the stretch as you lead toward conference play. You got another tall order coming up against St. Mary, but we'll discuss that in just a moment. 
You got six guys in double figures, you're at 26 of 31 from the line, at the half you're trailing by 5. 
Mhmm.
41 36. 
Mhmm.
What do you tell the guys at the half? Because you you put it all together. You had the perfect storm to come together in that second half. What do you tell these guys at the half?
Well, uh might have told them the other night against Oregon State, we're down 14 at the half. So you see the improvement you've made already. And then in you know obviously Fresno - I I I thought Fresno probably would give us more trouble, if not - as much if not more trouble than Oregon State because they're so athletic. That you know that right there just showed them and I tried to you know really press the issue the fact that we've shown that much improvement in um in 48 hours. Just with watching film, you know having open discussions and and and getting feedback from the guys, and really just stepping to the practice floor we've already shown you know improvement that we were down five points to a very formidable team. 
You know have been defending Mountain West uh champions uh you know from last year. But, you know what, we were right there. Probably shouldn't have been down five. We made a couple mistakes in at the end. Gave them - gave them some easy baskets and things like that. But, I I I thought that you know once we realized, hey you know what, you can ... uh not only play with these guys but you do the things we need to do and really lock in, you know, we can come out victorious. 
So uh they came out, we didn't hold them in the locker room too long, they came out, they got warmed up really good. You know, we started the second half having the basketball. And um, you know we we got it we got it tied up pretty quick and ended up taking the lead. You know it was just it was just our night tonight, Mike. You know we we ee countered everything that they wanted to do. 
Um. They really had a hard time defending us on the pick and roll. That is something, you know is very simple, but yet it is very, very hard to guard, you know the pick and roll. And we did a really good job and our players schoo - school - uh vocal just kind of vocally where they you know really kind of spearheaded us uh you know offensively uh and just kept the ball to the right people. And uh and you know and obviously if they started fouling us, we probably would have made free throws pop at that. So total team effort. Very, very proud of our guys. I'm happy for them. They've worked so hard, too much to prepare for the season, and we just want something good to happen this year, they've worked so hard. 
And we're trying to do everything we can whether its in player view in the high slash
 well it's an absolute great joy to watch these guys uh transition up and down the court, and and how they're putting it all together. The comraderie is building. And a win like this, as we mentioned earlier, can go such a long way.

37,Scripted Broadcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-Unq3R--M0,"For most of history, the overwhelming majority of the Earth's inhabitants have owned more or less nothing. The clothes they stood up in, some bowls, a pot and a pan, perhaps a broom. And if things were going really well, a few farming implements. Nations and peoples remained consistently poor. Global GDP did not grow at all from year to year. The world was an aggregate as hard up in 1800 as it had been at the beginning of time. 
However, starting in the early 18th century, in the countries of Northwestern Europe, a remarkable phenomenon occurred. Economies began to expand and wages to rise. Families who'd never before had any money beyond what they needed just to survive, found they could go shopping for small luxuries, a comb or a mirror, a spare set of underwear, a pillow, some thicker boots, or a towel. 
Their expenditure created a virtuous economic cycle. The more they spent, the more businesses grew, the more wages rose. By the middle of the 18th century, observers recognized that they were living through a period of epochal change, that historians have since described as the world's first consumer revolution. 
It was in Britain where the changes were most marked. Enormous new industries sprang up to cater for the widespread demand for goods that had once been the preserve of the very rich alone. In England's cities you could buy furniture from Chippendale, Hepplewhite, and Sheraton. Pottery from Wedgwood and Derby. Cutlery from the Smitheries of Sheffield. And hats, shoes, and dresses featured in the best-selling magazines like the Gallery of Fashion and The Ladies Magazine. 
Styles for clothes and hair, which had formerly gone unchanged for decades, now altered every year, often in extremely theatrical and impractical directions. In the early 1770's, there was a craze for decorated wigs so tall, their tops could only be accessed by standing on a chair. It was fun for the cartoonists. So vivid and numerous were the consumer novelties, that the austere doctor Johnson wryly wondered whether prisoners were also soon to be hanged in a new way.
The Christian church looked on and did not approve. Up and down England, clergymen delivered bitter sermons against the new materialism. They called it ""vanity,"" which was a sin. Sons and daughters were to be kept away from shops. God would not look kindly on those who paid more attention to household decoration than the state of their souls. 
But there now emerged an intellectual revolution that sharply altered the understanding of the role of vanity in an economy. In 1723, a London physician called Bernard Mandeville published an economic tract titled The Fable of the Bees, which proposed that contrary to centuries of religious and moral thinking, what made countries rich, and therefore safe, honest, generous, spirited, and strong, was a very minor, unelevated, and apparently undignified activity: shopping for pleasure. 
It was the consumption of what Mandeville called ""fripperies"", hats, bonnets, gloves, butter dishes, soup tureens, shoehorns, and hair clips that provided the engine for national prosperity, and allowed the government to do in practice what the church only knew how to sermonize about in theory: make a genuine difference to the lives of the weak and the poor. 
The only way to generate wealth, argued Mandeville, was to ensure high demand for absurd and unnecessary things. Of course, no one needed embroidered handbags, silk-lined slippers, or ice creams, but it was a blessing that they could be prompted by fashion to want them. For on the back of demand for such trifles, workshops could be built, apprentices trained, and hospitals funded. Mandeville shocked his audience with the starkness of the choice he placed before them. A nation could either be very high-minded, spiritually elevated, intellectually refined, and dirt poor; or a slave to luxury and idle consumption, and very rich. Mandeville's dark thesis went on to convince almost all the great Anglophone economists and political thinkers of the 18th century. 
There were, nevertheless, some occasional departures from the new economic orthodoxy. One of the most spirited and impassioned voices was that of Switzerland's greatest philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Shocked by the impact of the consumer revolution on the manners and atmosphere of his native Geneva, he called for a return to a simpler, older way of life, of the sort he had experienced in Alpine villages or read about in travellers' accounts of the native tribes of North America. 
In the remote corners of Uppinsale or the vast forests of Missouri there was, blessedly, no concern for fashion and no one-upmanship around hair extensions. Rousseau recommend closing Geneva's borders and imposing crippling taxes on luxury goods, so that peoples' energies could be redirected towards non-material values. He looked back with fondness to the austere marshall spirit of Sparta.",History: Consumerism,04:54,00:07,TRUE

I see I see a bunch of short arms here. Okay, can you put your arms up if you really would like to that ... okay. 
Uh now I have a friend who uh he told me, he said, ""Mel do you use Outlook?"" And I said, ""Not really."" But I actually really do. I don't really use all the functionalities of Outlook. I have a shared calendar with my staff so they know where I'm at, right? And they put appointments on there and I put appointments, and they get to know know what my schedule is. 
But as far as using it as a contact management system, using as a way to remind me of things, using it as a way to just send myself alerts, using it as a way to keep uh notes on conversations that I have with the clients and the prospects, I don't do that. I haven't done that. Uh and used to do it. Years ago I had a program that was called Hopper, which is rather expensive but a really awesome program. 
And what I've heard about this thing, Outlook, is that the cost is really affordable. 
That's right. 
Free right? 
It's free.
Free.
Isn't that a great price?
With the purchase of a computer.
Yeah, it's a great price. And I bet you can put it on your smart phone too. I bet, don't you think? Put it on your smart phone?
So it's a powerful, powerful tool uh and I and I have - and my friend Craig Holder who is an ambassador at Outlook, 
Oh.
He is going to give some updates on how you can use Outlook as a uh management program of your time. 
Before I do that let me share a couple of things that's happening with us with company. We've ordered more furniture, hopefully; we've paid for it. We're just waiting for it to get delivered, man. It's just amazing you know we we have enough chairs to support this work station ... 
These are comfortable chairs. 
You like those?
Oh nice. They are very nice. 
Oh good.
They are very comfortable. 
Oh good. I'm glad, glad. Come and use them. Okay, great. 
All right, so we we've got chairs on order for another work station like this; it's a little bit shorter, in the area where the copy room is at, right? And then we're ordering some partitions around the work stations where Nancy and Floyd and Jeanette's area is. Okay, so that's what we're doing.
We ordered a reception area that's really nice and sleek - sleek looking, but you know we paid them May 26th and they were supposed to be delivered three weeks later. But uh it's not here yet. They tell us it will be here Friday, so we'll see. We'll see if it's going to come. 
Uh, what we're planning to do is start to decorate our office. You know all these paintings have been on the walls; we'll use some of them, some of them we won't. Um and um what we're going to do is just make our place really, really beautiful. A great, attractive area to be. 
I want to share with you there are a lot of agents in our neighboring markets here who don't know about us. And I want you to tell them. And I'm going of offer you a bounty. I'm going to offer you a bounty. Do you know what a bounty is? 
A reward? 
A reward, yeah. So let's say every agent that you bring our way, that signs up with us, on their first two transactions, I will give you 500. Each agent. 
Esteem? Or - 
No, when they close. 
Oh.
When they close. 
Or buyer?
I don't care if it's a buyer or a seller, when they close a transaction you'll get 500 from our company, for each one ... 
I was just coming up and his guy was walking and then he walked in and he goes, ""Is there a realtor here?""  I go, ""Yeah, upstairs."" 
He goes, Sahara?""  I go ""No, Mel Wilson."" I said, ""May I help you?"" He goes, ""I work next door, but it's my break right now and I used to be a realtor and I wanted to come in."" And I said, ""Go upstairs and somebody might be able to, you know, talk to you."" Then I realized you guys had a meeting, but by the time I came back he goes, ""No, I don't have time right now"" because like he had a ten minute break. 
Did you give him your card? 
I came in to get a card to give it and then ...
... he's gone.
He's gone, because he had only ... I guess he was on his break. He was smoking ...

And this is again just for representation of all of your hard work. So uh we had over uh ... This is just April's statistics, and so over 37 million in volume for April alone. So we're up quite a bit over this time last year. So April last year, as well as transactions are up, um and commissions are up again. So congratulations to all of you on great work there.
Is there a reason that the .... With no effort?
So the only thing that we're coming up with is that if some people are getting - taking less commissions on some things but we're diving into that right now. So these are the numbers that 
- big spread -
Kyle gave me and it's a big spread, I agree with you. So
Yeah, Jeff said - if that's the case, yeah. So way to go John. Thanks for bringing out numbers down. Uh,
The other great piece of news is from real trends. So, there's a sheet that Kayla handed out. And so Remax of Grand Rapids again ranked uh within the top 50 brokerages nationwide, so this is even outside of just Remax brokerages, and we're number 13. This is just a huge accomplishment, and this is based on ranking brokerages on transactions per agent. So, with that large number there, really it's just a testament to how experienced our agents are, how much business they're doing, and a great piece of marketing material for you as well, when you start talking with folks about, 'Hey, come work with the best. You know we have the best of the best over at Remax of Grand Rapids, and the proof is right here when you rank us against all the brokerages in the nation.' So really, something to be incredibly proud of. 
Um we're up from last year. I think last year around 20th or so, and so we climbed. And so we're really proud of everybody here for all of their effort and we really want to break that top 10 next year. So we're on a strong pace to do that. 
We'll never be number one there though. 
Yeah, that one is uh -
That's kind of an anomaly that I really think they should be thrown out as an outliner, but they are... Pat mentioned what their - what that company is. Yeah, I can't remember what it is. 
Yeah, they're just the transaction side. They're not actually like selling agents, but they're still kind of
on the Facebook posts.
I saw that. That's just
It's absurd.

Wow.
But really, just a great piece of uh marketing material for you. We're going to do some uh boosted Facebook ads around this, as well, to help promote the company. Um. And really as well, for agents who are interested in coming to to work with us. The best of the best really reside here, so if they want to surround themselves with that, this is a great piece of marketing material for that as well. 
So congratulations to all of you on that. It's impressive. Very impressive. 
It's just impressive that we actually got into top 50.
That's huge, isn't it? I mean, right there is just proof that the brand has so much power and we really do have the best of the best, like Dave Monitor always says. 
So speaking of that and the best of the best. We had the opportunity to uh participate in an event where many of those the  'best of the best' brokers were in attendance, at broker catalyst and premiere broker summit. And for the first time they they combined the two, where we got a lot more interaction with those uh the premier brokers that come in, so really those are the really large guys doing 200 plus um agents and significant amount of volume.

You've probably noticed that there's no Home button. That's because we've made it even easier to get around your phone. Now, wherever you are, you can just swipe up to go home.
If you want to see all the apps you have open, swipe from the bottom and pause. Then, swipe to move between your apps. You can even swipe along the bottom of an app to go from one to another. To get to the Control Center, simply swipe down from the top right. While you're in Control Center, you can press firmly using 3D Touch to do things like turn up the sound or brighten the screen. To dismiss Control Center, just swipe up.
Want to see all of your notifications in one place? Swipe down from the top and there they are. Swipe right to see your widgets or left to quickly access your camera. You can also get to the camera or the flashlight just by pressing firmly on these buttons. Want to talk to Siri? You can still say, ""Hey, Siri,"" but now you can also press and hold the side button to talk to Siri anytime. To turn your iPhone off, press and hold the side button and either volume button, then swipe.
All right, so what is Face ID? All the things you used to do with Touch ID, you can now do with Face ID. Your face is your password. It's simple to set up. Just rotate your head around, like this. Now your iPhone will recognize you whenever you look at it, whether you're indoors, outdoors or even in total darkness. What if you change up your look? No problem. It can recognize you with a new hairstyle, a beard, different makeup, glasses, even in many types of sunglasses.
To unlock your iPhone 10, just look at it. And you don't have to like, hold it up to your face. With a simple glance, your iPhone can recognize you. See how the lock icon opens? From here, you can just swipe up with your thumb to go home. And no need to wait for it to unlock, you can glance and swipe all in one motion. When notifications pop up, they stay private until you look. One glance and there they are.
To make secure purchases with Apple Pay, double-click the side button, glance at your iPhone to authenticate, and hold your iPhone near the terminal to complete your purchase. Easy, right? Finally and most importantly, all of your face data is securely stored right on your iPhone. It's never backed up to iCloud or any server.
Sure, you've used emojis, but you've never actually been one until now. With Animojis, you can become one of 12 characters, like a monkey, a cat or this guy. The TrueDepth camera maps over 50 muscles in your face in real time to capture your every expression. To send an Animoji, just start a conversation in Messages. Then, open the Animoji app and choose which one you want to be. Hit record. 
Hey mom, how do I look? And press stop when you're done.
If you change your mind, you can switch characters. Once you've found the perfect one, just tap send. You can even make an Animoji a sticker. Just strike a pose, touch, and hold the Animoji. Then, drag it anywhere inside the conversation. 
On iPhone 10, both the front and rear-facing cameras have Portrait mode, so now even your selfies will look more amazing.
You can also add some new studio lighting effects with Portrait lighting. It's simple to do. When you're in Portrait mode, slide to choose between five different lighting effects, then shoot. You can also edit the lighting effect afterwards. Go to the portrait and select edit, then choose the lighting effect you want. Creating a whole new look is that easy. These are just some of the great new features on iPhone 10. Thanks for watching.",iPhone 10 — A Guided Tour — Apple,04:22,,FALSE

Yeah.
You'd liberate me from only being on computers, and I'd free you from just being a toothbrush.
Let me guess, together we'd reach our full potential.
As part of the internet of things.
Internet of things.
We'd create and share data, and by analyzing all of that information, we'd learn how to do things better, improve lives, and build new experiences. 
Dental hygiene experiences?
Ha ha. Well, internet of things is about connecting any physical object to the internet. There will be between 30 and 50 billion IoT devices within the next few years. The only limit is your imagination.
Okay. Well, if I had to imagine, I'd rather be a self sustaining urban farm, a smart vehicle, or why not, a connected oyster.
I totally could have come up with those, too.
Well, it's not that hard. Asta Roseway is already collaborating with urban farmers and machine learning researchers to design connected aquaponic farm modules that utilize real time crop analytics. This will be essential when nearly three quarters of the people around the world live in cities. Or someday, it could even be a self sustaining food solution for long distance space travel.
What?
And Ros Harvey at i-tech company, The Yield, is using connected sensors to measure salinity, temperature, and water depth in dozens of Australian oyster estuaries. Cloud computing and artificial intelligence are bringing greater visibility and accuracy to the fragile feet of bivalve production.
Or, there's Peggy Johnson, forging partnerships with automotive giants like Nissan, Toyota, and BMW, to transform vehicles into intelligent platforms powered by the Microsoft Cloud. So, one day your car might also be your mobile office, helping schedule meetings, find a location, and even drive you there, all with the world class digital security you need in a device that travels at 60 miles per hour.
That's like a lot to ... Getting back to that toothbrush.
Well, let's not make the mistake the thinking of IoT in terms of single devices. It's really an ecosystem of devices across homes, businesses, and industries. One must have the skill, experience, and the steady hand to manage the whole ecosystem. Like Microsoft IoT Insider Lab, that supports startups and major enterprises to invent the next generation of IoT through hardware design, manufacturing, app development, and connecting devices to the cloud at scale.

I'm Shauna Bainbridge, I am a controller. I oversee our Minneapolis team of fund accounting professionals up on the third floor. Some of you I know but a lot of you I'm probably meeting for the first time.
So as Linda alluded, we're here to talk about best practices and I think we do have a culture here of best practice process improvement. I recently headed up a B to B, or a backpack to briefcase event that we had. I was trying to get some statistics prior to that event of what our process improvement and best practices teams do. And through January through October we had had 63 ideas brought to that committee, generally from our accountants or shared serviced individuals that they have an idea, and they wanted to bring that idea to the attention of management and leadership to vet that idea and to identify if there was something there that the that the department could benefit from. 
So I want to ensure that you guys understand that we have that culture here within real estate accounting but I also thing that we can do even more. And that's why we identify this as a breakout session, is to get that fire burning inside of you to - If you have that idea, and it might not always be the final result, but it's that first idea that starts the conversation that leads to more conversation that eventually leads to that wonderful idea that can lead to something great.
And the one example I reflect on that I thought was so impactful, and I know you guys recognize it as well, that we had a process, it's been over a year ago now, that we used to key in our journal entries into MRI and Yarvy, and it took a long time to do that. And one individual said, well wait a second, I think we could probably upload those into the system and make that efficient. And fast forward, we went through best practices, and now it's an upload process. And I've asked quite a few people around and they said, how much does that save, time? And the consistent estimate that I keep receiving is that per property, per month it saves an hour. And just think of that time that we created to build into taking on additional properties. You know, freeing up ourselves up to do more analytical work versus just keying a journal entry into the system. That's huge, so I think that's like a process improvement for tactical things that we wanna hear more of and that to lead to great things. And I know Shauna has another example as well.
Yeah, so my example is less tactical but it's really, how can I improve myself as a manager? A few years ago the team was really small. I had seven people on the team, I could talk to everyone, everyday. I knew what was going on with their work life, their personal life. Fast forward a couple years and now the team is over 20 almost 25 people and there's just no way I can know everything that's going on. And I really struggled with that. 
One thing that came to mind was, I had a team member who had a day off because he was going to sit for a section of the CPA exam, and I knew that. I knew he was taking the exam. But come the day before his day off I said, hey have a good day off, enjoy your time. Forgetting that it was actually not just a day off, he was sitting for the CPA exam. I felt terrible when someone told me about that after the fact, so I set myself a calendar reminder for the day he was coming back so I could personally ask him how it went instead of just being an aloof manager who didn't know what was going on. This is a personal and work related item. 
After that I talked to a few other managers here that I know to be pretty good managers and asked how - how do you connect with your people on a day to day basis, with it being a genuine, you know real way, without it being a forced conversation. So you know I got a mixed bag of different ways and what I kind of decided was, I should just try to make personal connections with a couple people as I see them in the lunch room or in the copy - break room, and the if there's a follow up item, following up, seeking them out a couple of days later, asking how things went or you know, asking about whatever we had talked about. 
That's something I'm still working on because I still struggle. I really would like to be on a personal level with everybody but I know that that's not possible. Um, part of this session could be what you guys think or what do you guys do to maintain a level of connection with members of your team either if they report directly to you or maybe they just report to another manager.",CBRE Manager Meeting Q4 2017,04:28,,FALSE

Abstain. Okay thank you Jeanne. 
All right, great. Thanks Mark. We'll now move forward to item number three discussion and possible action of acupuncture board ethics continuing education requirement. For licencees and possible recommendation to the board and I will let Mark take us through that.
Okay, I'm actually gonna, I I'll just sort of quickly review the history of this but I'm gonna have Jay Hurt who is our education coordinator, uh take it just as it's, it, sort of, falls under his uh purview. Basically this is a this is an issue that we've um had for a little while um in our in our world, as they say. The language was originally approved back at the November 11th, 2012 board meeting. In discussion with legal counsel and talking among staff the feeling is that the the existing text that was approved back in 2012 is is a little vague and um maybe requires a little more definition. Um and we have set out some questions for the board members there's some things to possibly discuss. Um, And so the idea would be to perhaps, discuss the issue um if you'd like, provide direction to staff, we can um come up with some additional, or refine language and bring it back to the committee or the board, whatever the committee decides to do. So, that's kind of the goal here.
And I'm Jay Hurt the Education Coordinator with the Acupuncture Board. And as background, um ... as background um I looked at a number of other boards in terms of what they have done with ethics. And particularly, um we looked the chiropractic board, the board of psychology, and the board of physical therapy. And they're very similar as that the patients are going to be seeing um practitioners in a um sole proprietor situation so there is a good comparison there. Um and so I just give you a quick summary of what those boards do and then I'll let it go back to the board and they can discuss or further define what professional ethics are for the Acupuncture Board. 
So uh the chiropractor board, um Chiropractic Board requires two hours of uh um uh ethics and law continuing education for each licensing cycle. And in addition, the Chiropractic Board has a uh law and ethics supplemental exam that applicants are required to take for um licensure. 
Um the Physical Therapy Board, um in a similar vein, has two hours of uh uh continuing education in law and ethics required. And they also have a um California law exam that is required for licensure. And it it's not just looking at the regulations, these law exams are the complete overview of California law.
Um, the Psychology Board. Um. The Psychology Board does not require any uh CE units in ethics but they do uh require, um each licensing cycle, that the licensee attest to the fact that they have kept up with ethics and law as based on their their regulatory structure.

Um so with the - the subject is we don't get much assigned to us, but um since I've become the public uh uh employees chair, I have received all kind of feedback from different employees about things that are going on in the city, and I realized that I don't know enough about what's going on or how people properly complain. I know that um Auburn Williamson uh I think you sponsored a whistle blowers bill a few years ago, um but I don't know that our employees know how to address these issues. You know, even though we have things, we don't... You cannot steal 'em yet. Just a minute. 
You cannot... uh, they don't know how to address things there. They don't know who to talk to, so I get all these uh anonymous letters. I mean, I got a stack of them just from them knowing my name over the years, so I thought that we should have something that um everybody knows about on this committee and then something that we can put out to the employees better about how, if they're being harassed sexually, um if they're being intimidated racially, if they're being uh passed over for employment, black, white, green, orange, whatever, uh if uh they're being assaulted... and then I found that we have a uh loophole in our whole thing as far as when people go work for accepted offices that we really didn't have a way to address that issue. And I found that out personally, because this was done personally to me. And so I I'm very fortunate to be able to work with personnel, we've got very smart people over there, so I have Mr. Richard Franks here and Miss...
Sylvia Donaldson.
Sylvia - Sylvia Donaldson. Sylvia Donaldson, if you would - if you two would to sit at the end of the table, they brought us some handouts, and we're going to learn about - we're going to learn about uh uh how to complain effectively in all branches of government. And I know that several people have to go over to make a form over in public safety, I'm going to let you go because the alderman from the 18th is lurking outside. 
Haha! Lurking outside! And so...
We'll be right back.
I'll try not to go too fast, okay?
Okay, thanks.
Oh my god.
The good news is they probably know 95% of this. 
We'll be back.
Okay. Even if you know it, it's a good refresher course.
And the director will tell you, I was 100 for 100 as an investigator. 
Alright. 
Yes. He nailed them. He did. 
That's good! But all of us should...
I never lost an appeal.
Okay, great! Okay. Mr. Franks, Mrs. Donaldson?
Donaldson.
Okay.
Sylvia is our employee relations manager, and in order to uh kind of give you a full scope of what she does again, her unit is responsible for uh investigating any kinds of EEOC complaints that come in for civil service employees, complaints from the Missouri Commission of Human Rights, uh any kinds of Department of Labor issues. She also administers the city-wide Family Medical Leave program, she does all the drug and alcohol testing and will be meeting with Alderman Titus and myself and the police chief and uh Judge Jimmy Edwards next Tuesday to discuss updates and to get feedback. Um, she does a number of if different duties in her capacity, but really I think it's the most complex unit of the Department of Personnel. 
We have governing department personnel administrative regulations who is not here today is uh Dell Jones, she's our training and organizational development manager. She makes sure that every single new employee has to go through the new employee orientation class. And during that class, they are advised of their rights, particularly we hit these important ones with um the drug and alcohol policy with the people who have to sign the form on on uh on initial employment, and also about the harassment policy, the anti-harassment policy. They they are also given instruction on the EEOC policy and a number of other policies. So they get that when they are first made employees. And of course all of these are online. In addition, we do supervisory training that is mandatory, and that is given frequently. Out of the next three months, July, August, September, um we're giving two classes. So we do that training.
I will also say that because we have a lot of career seasonal people or just seasonal people who come in the summer that aren't familiar with the city process, we tend to have a little bit more problems with them, so","Public Employees - July 12, 2018",04:39,00:18,TRUE

9th and welcome to our village premiere care staff meeting. Um. We are growing, and uh we wanted to ha - take an opportunity to just review who we are and what we're doing. And um figure out next steps for um just growing and coordinating. But also, just - I'm recording this so that as I train new people or we have a substitute midwife that there's some record of how we get things done. 
Um, so we've been doing this since 2010. Pretty cool huh?
Yeah.
And um Stephanie and Maeve have been instrumental in all that coming about. Especially since Stephanie designed the binder. The binders worked out pretty well.
Okay.
Yeah? 
Yeah.
I've been wanting to ask you if you would be available or willing to expand it?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah? Okay.
We can revise some of it too.
Yeah. Okay. It would be nice um if it had ... I think it needs two more sections. So that there's enough variety for over enough sessions. What do you think?
Yeah.
Okay. Um. One of the things that I did recently was to do this checklist.Um and I know I put it in here, this is the checklist. There's several of them. It's a work in progress. And what what I'll do is, I also want to walk us through like look looking at the space and reminders of some of the details of set up and where things go. Like where to find things; where to put things away and all that. 
But before we do that, I wanted to review our groovy mission statement. Ask you guys if you think there's anything Mavis should revise or change to. So our team provides quality, safe maternity care facilitated support groups and education for parenting preparation and planned home birth in a way that mothers and fathers can feel transformed by their experience welcoming a new baby, able to say, ""I was seen, and heard, and felt empowered by my care.""
Our values are respect above all else for client's self determination. Keep listening, we like to deliver wow through service. Maintain some humility, have fun and be a little weird. Um. Hold safety, quality of care above all else by having good communication, working as a team, knowing limitations, and robust practices in routines. We facilitate and mentor rather than teach or direct. It's our ""Birthing from Within"" fundamental principle. Um. It's been by working as a team but I - I skipped, I went backwards. Um, like to maintain some flexibility and awareness of compassion. 
I guess the compassion piece is like, you know just understanding we often don't know everything about a person's background and why they might be challenging or annoying or whatever. And to put aside our expectations and judgments for that moment in order to serve that client better.",VPN Staff Meeting July 2014 1,04:56,,FALSE
46,Scripted Broadcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU,"In college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So you know, you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, and things stay civil. And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would - I would have it all ready to go, but then actually the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this. And that would happen every single paper.
But then came my 90 page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. I knew for a paper like that, my normal workflow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear, just like a little staircase. How hard could it be to just walk up the stairs. No big deal, right? 
But then the funniest thing happened. Those first few months, they came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff, so we had an awesome new revised plan. And then - but then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could. I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one, but two all nighters. Humans are not supposed to pull two all nighters. Sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline.
I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later, I get a call. It's the school, and they say, ""Is this Tim Urban?"" And I say, ""Yeah."" And they say, ""We need to talk about your thesis."" I say, ""Okay."" And they say, ""It's the best one we've ever seen."" 
That did not happen. It was a very, very bad thesis. I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, ""This guy is amazing."" No, no, it was very, very bad. 
Anyway, today I'm a writer blogger guy. I write the blog Wait, But Why. A couple of years ago I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. 
Now I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different then the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non procrastinator, and I - so I could compare them, and I actually brought them here to show you today. And I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. And I know that if you're not a trained brain expert it's not that obvious, but just take a look, okay? So here's the brain of a non procrastinator. 
Now, here's my brain. There is a difference.
Both brains have a rational decision maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an instant gratification monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. So the rational decision maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like that plan. So he actually takes the wheel, and he says, ""Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened."" 
Then - then we're going to go over to the fridge, we're going to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets, and end much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today, sorry.

Do you recognize that there's there's actually-
... and 0.002 cents.
Yes. Do you recognize there's a difference between those two numbers?
No. 002 dollars  and 0.002 cents.
Yes. Is there a difference between-
They're both the same, if you look at them on paper wise.
No, they're not, actually.
So if you take 0.002
Cents, remember. It's cents.
Times 35896, it $71.79
No, that would be 71 cents. How much should I be charged?
By - by the way this is calculated? $71.79. You're paying two-tenths of a penny per kilobyte.
Two-tenths? Hold on. Hold on. Two-tenths of a penny would be point 2 cents. You quoted me 0.002 cents, so which is the real rate?
0.002, sir.
0.002 what?
Cents per kilobyte.
So you just said it was point 2 pennies, and then you also said it's 0.002 cents. Those are two completely different numbers. They're 100 fold different.

Sure.

Hi. Do you recognize that there's a difference between one dollar and one cent?
Definitely.
Do you recognize that there's a difference between half a dollar and half a cent?
Definitely.
Then do you therefore recognize that there's a difference between 0.002 dollars and 0.002 cents?
No.
I'm teaching math here.
And I mean, I'm trying to get what you're saying here, but it's just not-
And we're talking about cents, right?
Right, point 002. If we multiply that by the amount of kilobytes usage that you have-
35893.
35893, that comes out to what you paid, 71 79.

I don't know. I'm not a mathematician.

We're not quoting 0.002 dollars. We're quoting 0.002 cents.

It's not opinion! Okay, well, you know what? I'm gonna post this recording on my blog, and-

However, there is also um uh research and evidence to say that um some of the very narrow imaging and uh very careful um presentations of messages lifestyles and bodies on social media, particularly on Instagram um can really um narrow young people's ideas as to um what their own um bodies should look like and um what their own life should look like. Um and this can very much fade into negative thoughts around self-worth and um can fade into uh feeling of low mood and also feeling anxious. 
The - I suppose the main presentations of mental health problems that - that we see um includes um anxiety and depression. Um we talk about them as high prevalence um mental health problems because they're quite - quite common. For anxiety, young people can experience intrusive thoughts that um they have difficulty managing and and  can be very, very persistent, and they can get stuck on those thoughts and that can make kind of sleep really difficult. It can make concentration very difficult. It can make relationships hard. We can see young people disconnecting from um friendship groups uh and from activities that they normally quite enjoyed. 
In terms of um uh low mood and depression, we can see uh that it can become a very um whole body experience, very overwhelming. Uh, there can be impacts on sleeping patterns. Feeling very, very lethargic, um unable to get out of bed, unable to find motivation to do um activities and tasks that young people have uh normally found quite easy, uh difficulty in concentrating, making decisions. Sometimes young people that are experiencing depression and low mood will talk about not feeling um able to be on their own. 
What I do find um uh tricky and difficult is um posts and communities that are um coming from like a recovery focused um kind of messaging, particularly around body image and disordered hazing, um et cetera, because sometimes there is a bit of blurring of the lines around um good messages around body image and um you know a positive hazing and sometimes uh what gets promoted as a healthy lifestyle is really um you know quite rigid hazing and adherence to what sounds like a clean diet but is really not a balanced, healthy diet, particularly for young people that are going through rapid um growth and cognitive development. Um those kind of communities and pages can be really risky. 
We were just starting to to see the strength in the digital space in terms of being able to give young people a soft entry to support and that's been um a really uh you know great and valuable um thing that has happened through technology. 
Our main day to day work with young people is um uh individual counselling and so what we aim to do is is create a sort - support plan that is tailored to um the needs of the young person and thus responds to what their goals are. ",Phone interview with Liz from Headspace,04:29,00:00,TRUE
